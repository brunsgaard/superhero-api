## Build a superhero api with machine learning capabilities

Dataset and exercise that we use as part of the hiring process for machine
learning related jobs at e-conomic (Visma).

From `exercise.tex`;

> Here at e-conomic we really love superheros. In fact we love superheros
> so much that we have decided to start a new department which will focus
> solely on inventing new superhero characters. Our team of dedicated
> inventors will think out new awesome characters and for each new creation
> the inventor will devise a character description containing information
> such as abilities, partnerships, team affiliations, etc.
> 
> The two legendary US publishers, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, have shown
> great interest in our new department, and they would like to make offers
> on each new character....
>
> Due to market circumstances, when a new character is offered to a
> publisher, all other publishers lose interest in buying that character,
> because they are afraid that the company who got the offer first, may
> steal the idea and bring onto the market a similar superhero, before the
> investment can be legally secured.
>
> That is why we need your help! We mined Wikipedia for Marvel- and
> DC-superhero articles, and now we hand you the dataset.
>
> Your task is to build a RESTful API that (i) manages the articles, (ii) and
> offers a prediction endpoint, that uses machine learning to classify a text
> as being either closer to the Marvel or the DC universe.
