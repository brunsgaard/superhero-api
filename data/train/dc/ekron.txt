Fictional character biography

Ekron is an ancient construct supposedly created by the Guardians of the
Universe of Oa. By the 21st century it was little more than a large
floating head serving as the Green Lantern of the planet Vengar. The eye
of Ekron possesses properties and powers similar to those of the Green
Lanterns' power rings, and was designed as the rings' prototype. During
the Infinite Crisis event, one of Ekron's eyes was stolen by the alien
bounty hunter Lobo, which left Ekron powerless against an invasion
headed by the supervillain Lady Styx. This invasion annihilated all of
the space sector Ekron was pledged to protect, driving the construct
insane. Ekron's attempts to reclaim its lost eye pulled it into conflict
with Lobo, and other  characters such as Animal Man, Adam Strange, and
Starfire, the latter of whom used the eye to stop villains from
destroying an entire space sector.

The eye of Ekron itself features prominently in many future-set
storylines in the  universe, as the weapon the "Eye of Ekron", wielded
by the Emerald Empress of the Fatal Five, nemeses of the Legion of
Super-Heroes.


Powers and abilities

The eye of Ekron has many of the powers of a Green Lantern power ring.
It can emit energy blasts and make constructs of pure energy. It can
also give the user super strength, flight, and the ability to survive in
the vacuum of space.
