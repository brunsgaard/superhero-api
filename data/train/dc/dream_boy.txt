ROL PURTHA, known as DREAM BOY, is a comic book fictional character, a
 superhero and comes from the planet Naltor. He first appeared
in Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes #18 at Legion Headquarters
just after the death of his predecessor Dream Girl, presumably as a
replacement by Naltor's High Seer. However, he later made a cryptic
comment that he was not sent by Naltor.


Fictional character biography

Dream Boy, along with Brainiac 5, received a visit from Dream Girl while
sleeping. She told him the Legion would use an extremely powerful
Phantom Zone projector, built by Brainiac 5 and delivered by Mon-El, in
their final move against the Dominators. At Cosmic Boy's demand, Dream
Boy told the Legionnaires and the Wanderers that Brainiac 5 would build
a bomb to kill the Dominators. The only people who knew the truth about
the "bomb" were; Brainiac 5, Cosmic Boy, Dream Boy, and Phantom Girl.

Dream Boy was the first to reveal to the Legionnaires Dream Girl's new
existence in The Dreaming. Dream Boy was listed as "off duty" in
Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #39.


Powers and abilities

Dream Boy has the ability to see visions of the future in his dreams.
However, as a second class precognitive, he foresees events seconds to
hours before they occur. Although he can also focus his visions on
objects, such as predicting Brainiac's security codes.
