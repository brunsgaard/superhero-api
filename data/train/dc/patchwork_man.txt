Plot

Patchwork Man was the second foe to fight the Swamp Thing. He had
been Gregori Arcane, the brother of Anton Arcane, another of the Swamp
Thing's foes, until he was killed after stepping on a land mine. His
brother Anton repaired his mutilated body and reanimated it. The result
was a monster, the Patchwork Man.

Gregori went insane and Anton locked him in with his second series of
Un-Men. In Swamp Thing #3, the Swamp Thing engages the Patchwork Man
in battle while endeavouring to rescue Abby. Due to his injuries and
transformation into a monster, the Patchwork Man could only remember
that Abby was his daughter and that he was to rescue her. He falls to
his apparent death, and the Swamp Thing and Abby go on to other
adventures.

He is believed to have died in a severe storm, where his body fell
apart, to be found by Abby.
