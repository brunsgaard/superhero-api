THE DINGBATS OF DANGER STREET are a fictional comic book gang of kids
published by . The Dingbats debuted in 1st Issue Special #6
(September 1975), and were created by Jack Kirby.


Publication history

In their 1st Issue Special story they (at least partly by accident)
stopped the villains Jumpin' Jack and the Gasser with the help of
Lieutenant Terry Mullins. Any suggestion that Mullins might become a
mentor like Jim Harper was dashed when Non-Fat told him "We wouldn't
give a grown-up the time of day! Grown-ups hate us â€“ and we hate
them!"

Kirby drew two further issues which were not published.

The Dingbats later reappeared in Adventures of Superman, one of a
number of Kirby homages by Karl Kesel. They first appear in brief
cameos, but are subsequently seen in full in Adventures of Superman
#549. They are squatting in a disused theatre, which the Newsboy Legion
claim was their hangout in the forties. Superman eventually calls in
another group of kids, the incredibly rich Green Team (another failed
First Issue Special creation created by Kirby's former partner Joe
Simon), to pay for converting the theatre into a youth club.

The group makes a cameo in the final issue of Batman: The Brave and the
Bold as Batmite is upset at the comic's cancellation and states several
missed crossover opportunities including the Dingbats.
