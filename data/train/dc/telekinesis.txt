TELEKINESIS is a mysterious character who appeared in Supergirl and the
Legion of Superheroes 28, as a member of a rival team to the Legion,
the Wanderers.


Fictional character biography

Telekinesis is an alien who apparently lacks arms or legs, and moves by
levitation. He was recruited by Mekt Ranzz to be a member of the
Wanderers, a covert mercenary team of metahumans created by the
Earthgov. Little is known about his history before joining, and he gives
little away by talking, as he speaks very little. It was later revealed
that he and the Wanderers have worked together with the Legion of
Super-Heroes to battle the Dominators.

When the public got to know that the planet Dominion had been blown up
on the demand of Cosmic Boy (although the truth was that it was sent to
the Phantom Zone), Brainiac 5 manipulated data from Vrax Gozzl so that
they would suggest that it was Mekt Ranzz's idea to implode the
Dominator homeworld, and that Titan Girl then psionically planted the
thought in Cosmic Boy's mind. When Mekt Ranzz was arrested, Telekinesis
and the other Wanderers disappeared.


Powers and abilities

Telekinesis has psychokinetic powers which allow him to move solid
objects with his mind. He can move an object roughly three times his own
bodyweight without strain, anything higher and he cannot move it at all.
He uses his power to levitate himself as he has no legs, and moves
objects mentally in place of using his arms (which he does not have)
