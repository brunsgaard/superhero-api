JOHN CONSTANTINE () (also known as HELLBLAZER) is a fictional
character, an antihero, appearing in comic books published by .
The character first appeared in The Saga of the Swamp Thing No. 37
(June 1985), and was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and John
Totleben. He serves as the lead character of the comic books
Hellblazer (1988–2013), Constantine (2013–2015), and Constantine:
The Hellblazer (2015&2016).

The titular HELLBLAZER, Constantine is a working class occult
detective and con man stationed in London. He is known for his endless
cynicism, deadpan snarking, ruthless cunning and constant chain smoking,
but is also a passionate humanist driven by a heartfelt desire to do
some good in his life. Originally a supporting character who played a
pivotal role in the "American Gothic" Swamp Thing storyline,
Constantine received his own comic in 1988. Pop artist Sting served as
visual inspiration for the character. A live-action film was released
in 2005 entitled Constantine, in which an Americanized version of the
character is played by actor Keanu Reeves. Welsh actor Matt Ryan was
cast in the role of Constantine for the 2014 NBC television series
Constantine, a role he reprised on the CW series Arrow.

The Hellblazer series was the longest-running and most successful
title of 's Vertigo imprint. Empire Magazine ranked Constantine
third in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time, while IGN
ranked him No. 29 in their Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and the character
ranked No. 10 in Wizard Magazine's Top 200 Comic Book Characters of
All Time.


Creation and conception

[The singer-songwriter Sting was the visual inspiration of the
character.] John Constantine first appeared in 1985 as a recurring
character in the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing, in which
he acted as a "supernatural advisor" to the main character.

In these early appearances, Constantine was depicted as a sorcerer of
questionable morality, whose appearance was based on that of the
musician Sting (specifically, as Sting appeared in the films Brimstone
and Treacle and Quadrophenia). Alan Moore created the character after
artists Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben, who were fans of the
Police, expressed a desire to draw a character who looked like
Sting. They had already drawn at least one character in Sting's
likeness, a briefly glimpsed background figure wearing a
black-and-red-striped T-shirt, in Swamp Thing No. 25 (1984) who was
later retroactively declared to be John Constantine. In his earliest
Swamp Thing appearances, the character is drawn with a marked
resemblance to Sting, and in Swamp Thing No. 51, Constantine appears
on a boat with the name The Honourable Gordon Sumner on the bow.

John Constantine's official debut was not until Swamp Thing No. 37,
when he was drawn by Rick Veitch. Crisis on Infinite Earths #4, his
second official appearance in a cameo role, shipped two weeks prior to
the release of Swamp Thing #37. In Crisis on Infinite Earths #4,
written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by George Perez, Constantine is
wearing a green suit as opposed to his more traditional black suit and
tan trenchcoat ensemble. Moore describes Constantine as being drawn from
a number of "really good ideas... about serial killers, the Winchester
House, and... want[ing] to draw Sting in a story." Calling these
disparate strands a "big intellectual puzzle", Constantine was the
result of "fit[ting] it all together." Initially created "purely to
get Sting into the story", by the time of the 1985 San Diego ComicCon,
Moore stated that "It's turning into something more than that now."
Veitch's contribution was to give Constantine an earring, something he
considered risque for 1985.

Asked in 1985 about the similarities between John Constantine and the
character Baron Winters (from Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan's Night
Force), Moore revealed that he was a "big fan" of Wolfman and Night
Force, but that there was "no intention to rip off Baron Winters".
He said: Constantine and Winters met each other during Moore's run on
Swamp Thing and again in Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic.

Speaking to comics magazine Wizard in 1993, Moore elaborated:

In 1988, Constantine was given his own title, Hellblazer. In 1993, at
the launch of 's Vertigo Comics imprint, Hellblazer was made an
official Vertigo publication. It was the longest continuously published
Vertigo title. Before the launch of the Vertigo line, Constantine
appeared in several  Universe titles, but for many years afterwards
editorial policy forbade the use of Constantine outside the Vertigo
line. The policy was reversed in 2011, when a version of Constantine
appeared in the  Universe crossover series Brightest Day, a spin-off
series, Brightest Day Aftermath: The Search for Swamp Thing.
Peter Milligan added him in the roster of The New 52 series Justice
League Dark. Milligan began writing Justice League Dark while
also writing the Vertigo's Hellblazer series, being a writer of both
series at the same time. In an interview, Milligan told Newsarama,

Beginning in Justice League Dark issue No. 9, Jeff Lemire assumed
writing duties on the series, replacing Milligan who had remained on the
Vertigo title. Speaking with CBR News exclusively, Lemire said he
considers Justice League Dark his dream gig at  because
Constantine is one of his all-time favourite characters not just in
comics, but in all fiction. Lemire also teased that while Constantine,
Zatanna and Deadman would remain on the roster, the team would change in
his opening arc and expand.

Characterization

Although a compassionate humanist who struggles to overcome the
influence of both Heaven and Hell over humanity, and despite his
occasional forays into heroism, Constantine is a foul-mouthed,
disillusioned, British cynic who pursues a life of sorcery and danger.
His motivation has been attributed to an adrenaline addiction that only
the strange and mysterious can sate. He also seems to be something of a
"Weirdness Magnet" (a term also used to describe Blue Devil). [John
Constantine discusses his previous girlfriends and boyfriends.]

Constantine is shown to be someone with a wide and international circle
of contacts and allies, and is adept at making friends. At the same
time, his close friends inevitably suffer or are outright killed simply
by being in his life; this has left a severe mark on him. In No. 69,
when the King of Vampires killed the man sleeping beside him and
casually asked if he'd been a friend, John replied "Must be. He's dead."

Constantine is bisexual. While early stories exclusively showed him
dating women, Ashes & Dust in the City of Angels revealed he had
previously dated men as well. His romantic relationships in
the New 52 have included numerous partners, most significantly Zatanna,
as well as the sorcerer Nick Necro; all have been fraught with distrust
and mutual disappointments. The relaunch Constantine the Hellblazer #1
(2015) reaffirmed Constantine's bisexuality through his interactions
with male and female characters in the issue.

Constantine also has a reputation as being one of the most powerful
sorcerers in the world. Despite this, Constantine rarely uses magic,
instead choosing to use his wits to trick his opponents. Constantine is
also referred to as "The Constant One" because of his whole family
tree being somewhat connected to the occult. Many of his ancestors are
sorcerers from different eras of history, and have taken part in many
known historical events. Some of his ancestors have roles in other works
outside Hellblazer, such as Batman: The Order of Beasts, The Sandman
and Books of Magic.

While Constantine has worn many clothes over the years, he was
originally portrayed as often wearing a blue pin-stripe suit, tan trench
coat. and occasionally gloves. As the series progressed, his trademark
attire became a grungier (or perhaps the same, just older) trench coat,
white shirt, and black tie, but eventually returned more to his earlier
fashion. Constantine smokes Silk Cut cigarettes, consuming thirty or so
a day. Constantine also occasionally breaks the fourth wall, where
he talks to the reader and narrates the story himself.

Real time aging

Constantine is unusual among comic book characters in that he has aged
in real time since his creation. During the first year of his solo
series, Constantine celebrated his 35th birthday. In the relevant issue
Constantine is reading a newspaper when he notices the date on the cover
is his birthday, making his date of birth 10 May 1953. Five years
later, on May 10, 1993, he turned 40. In Hellblazer, it was
mentioned multiple times that the aging process of Constantine
himself might be different due to the demon blood that he obtained from
Nergal. In a 2011 interview,  co-publisher Dan DiDio said that
"Constantine in the Vertigo universe is in his 60s, and what you have in
the  Universe is a character who is markedly younger".


Fictional character biography

Youth

In Constantine's early appearances in Swamp Thing, his past was a
mystery; his life as a child and young adult was not developed until
Jamie Delano's Hellblazer stories. John Constantine was born in
Liverpool, Merseyside on 10 May 1953. His mother, Mary Anne, died giving
birth to John and his stillborn twin brother because an earlier
abortion—forced on her by John's father, Thomas—had weakened her womb.
Because he was unable to accept responsibility for his wife's death,
Thomas blamed John and the pair grew up with a deep dislike for one
another. Whilst in the womb, John strangled his twin brother with
his own umbilical cord; in a parallel universe, the twin survives to
become the well-loved and well-adjusted magician that John never
was.

In their childhood, John and his older sister Cheryl lived briefly with
their aunt and uncle in Northampton to escape from their father's
alcoholism and subsequent imprisonment for stealing a female neighbour's
underwear. They moved back to Liverpool when their father was released.
John's bloodline and ancestry were known as the Laughing Magicians,
legendary mages who have the power over synchronicity and were infamous
for bluffing and tricking gods. This ancestry later drives John
Constantine to partake in his lineage and practice magic. One of John's
first acts of magic, as a child, was to hide all of his childhood
innocence and vulnerability in a box to rid himself of it. Later, in
the 1960s, a teenage John ran away from home, but not before a botched
curse caused his father to become withered and frail. John eventually
made his permanent home in London in 1969, rooming with Francis "Chas"
Chandler, a young man who has since gone on to become John's closest—and
longest surviving—friend.

During the 1970s, John became involved in occult circles in London. He
travelled other countries and visited San Francisco, where he met, and
subsequently began a relationship with, the female magician Zatanna
Zatara (in 's The New 52 however, the two met in New York). He
also became enamoured of punk rock; after seeing the Sex Pistols at the
Roxy Club in London in 1977, John cut his long hair, called himself
Johnny Con-Job, and formed his own band, Mucous Membrane, whose members
included Chandler (as a roadie), a drummer named Beano and fellow
Liverpudlian Gary Lester. They later released an album called Venus of
the Hardsell. John also performed as a famous stage magician in the
1980s, where he became famous for predicting the assassination attempt
on U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

John's first venture into occult "heroism" was a disaster. On tour with
Mucous Membrane at the Casa Nova Club in Newcastle, he found the
aftermath of a magical orgy gone horribly wrong: an abused child, Astra,
had conjured a hideous monster that took revenge on the adults who were
tormenting her, and the monster refused to leave. With typical
recklessness, John convinced some members of the band, along with
several occultist friends, to try destroying the creature by summoning a
demon of their own. Unfortunately, this demon was not under their
control and after it had destroyed the child's monster, it tormented
Constantine's friends and took the child to Hell. John suffered a
nervous breakdown after this incident, and was committed to Ravenscar
Psychiatric Hospital, which he drifted in and out of over the years.

The guilt of Astra hung over him for many years until, in his
mid-forties, he used some magic and con-artistry to free not only her,
but also the souls of all the other children trapped in Hell. As for the
rest of the "Newcastle Crew", the incident left the group both
physically and psychologically scarred. After helping Dream retrieve his
sands, Dream in turn relieves Constantine of the nightmares that had
plagued him since the incident.

Occult "hero"

John is later freed from Ravenscar by London gangsters, threatening him
to resurrect a mob boss's dead son whilst his sister's family pays the
price. John organises a group and manages to resurrect the boy. Years
later, John was able to persuade the same group to help with his
investigation of the Brujería cult, as seen in Swamp Thing Nos. 37–49.
The cult murdered most of them, including John's then-lover, Emma. These
people, and others who have died due to John's carelessness, have
continued to appear to him as silent, reproachful ghosts. Chas is the
most prominent one of very few human friends to have survived a
long-term association with John.

John first met Swamp Thing in 1985 after being interested in the
creature. John later acts as the Swamp Thing's protector, guide, and
voice of omen, even teaching the Thing to amplify his powers. Both would
have further adventure with each other, such as John introducing the
Thing to the Parliament of Trees, Thing using John's body to make love
to his wife and father a child named Tefe, and fighting off the
Damnation Army from summoning the Anti-Christ. Both carry a dull, but
nevertheless fruitful friendship with each other. Constantine even
invites Swamp Thing to his 40th birthday and assures the Thing he'll try
not to bother him again. In 1991 while in his late thirties, John
contracted terminal lung cancer. During this time, he sought the help of
a dying friend, Brendan, who had sold his soul to the First of the
Fallen, the most powerful lord of Hell. When the First came to collect
the soul, John tricked him into drinking holy water, which rendered him
helpless and prevented him from collecting the friend's soul at the
appointed time.

For this, the First promised to make John suffer unprecedented torment
in Hell when he dies. Slowly dying from cancer, John hatched a plan to
save himself from eternal torment. He secretly sold his soul to the
other two Lords of Hell. When they discovered Constantine's actions they
realized that they could not allow him to die, or else they would be
forced to go to all-out war over his soul, a war whose only winner would
be "the Lord of the Hosts," i.e., God and his angels. They were also far
too stubborn and proud, however, to enter anything resembling an
alliance. As a result, they were forced to cure John of his cancer.
This led to the First plotting a grand revenge on Constantine, who
manipulated the demon via his ally Ellie, a succubus, into coming into a
trap; the plan only barely succeeded, and while the First was
temporarily defeated many of John's friends were killed.

Constantine then went on to have a series of adventures and
misadventures playing the role of puppet and puppeteer with his
signature style and profane sarcasm. He managed to free Astra and every
other child in Hell, but at the cost of the First returning to power;
also, as part of the scheme, John's worst attributes were given separate
existence as "Demon Constantine" which meant he himself could not go to
Hell. As part of an attempt to regain his nastier edge, he used Ellie,
and this led to her taking out a revenge scheme in 1998 that forced him
to turn to the First for help; Ellie ended up in Hell and several of
John's oldest friends left him. John, being tired of all this, contacted
God. God appears and the two converse in a campfire. John then tells
him his reason for contacting Him. He warns God that if his soul is ever
sent to Hell, he would easily take over, and do nasty things such as
unleashing the demons and locking away Hell so that the damned cannot
enter and have no resting place. John blackmails God to do his bidding,
and that's to keep his soul away from Hell. God, knowing of John's
abilities, does so. But warns him of what will come next.

The 21st century

[Constantine's appearance in late 2003. Cover to Hellblazer #189. Art
by Tim Bradstreet.] On return to Britain in 2003 and after reconciling
with his sister (who believed he was dead), he went on to be involved in
a magic war in London and was horrified to find his niece Gemma, whom
he'd wanted to keep out of this life, had become a witch. He soon ended
up organising a counterstrike against a creature known as the Shadow
Dog, having been warned of its coming and believing it was an entity
that brought death and madness; instead, it was a guardian against the
true enemy, the Beast, who was manipulating John into giving it free
access to humanity. In the process, he was rendered an amnesiac, leaving
him vulnerable to the schemes of the demon Rosacarnis. To get his
memories back, he had to spend a day in her service, in which she had
him father three demonic children, who went on to massacre anyone who
knew Constantine, from friends to enemies to people who'd only briefly
met him. Among them was his sister Cheryl; one of his sons had exploited
her husband's religious fanaticism to make him see his wife as a witch —
and thus a person to be killed. This forced Constantine to go on journey
to Hell in the hopes to return his sister's soul. Accompanying him was
Nergal, the demon he thought he had killed by sending him to the border
of Heaven.

While in Hell, John and Nergal met the demon Constantine, who tried to
kill the original one. John was forced to let Nergal enter his body in
order to finish him. Later they also encountered Ellie, who seemed to
have quite pardoned John for him selling her out to the First. She was
not subject to any torture or punishment, either. The couple finally
arrived at Rosacarnis' hall, where there was a feast with all three of
Constantine's children, the First, and many demons from all Hell.
Because of Nergal's earlier possession of his body, any damage done to
John would be mirrored on Nergal. Nergal, however, calls the bluff,
showing that the effect goes both ways by clawing at his chest slightly.
John begs Rosacarnis to kill him to save his sister, but just as she's
about to, the First of the Fallen intervenes and immediately kills
Rosacarnis, since Constantine's soul is his by "right of insult" and
will only be taken when he deems fit. The First also kills Rosacarnis'
two sons, but spares the daughter, who had been dealing with issues of
identity and had doubts about whether she wanted to continue to exist.

Following this, the First commands Nergal to release the soul he's
holding. Cheryl's soul is pure and innocent and does not belong in Hell,
but the First offers her a truly devilish deal. Informing her that her
husband, Constantine's brother-in-law Tony, has killed himself with her
blood still staining his hands, thus making him twice damned, and
offering to fairly divide her husband's punishment between the two of
them if she stays of her own free will. Constantine attempts in vain to
argue that Tony murdered her and does not deserve that mercy. Despite
all that has happened, Cheryl still loves her husband enough to accept
the First's deal and decides to stay. Constantine can do nothing as the
First gloats over his victory and then sends him back home. Unable to
look at his niece Gemma's tear-filled eyes because of his failure,
Constantine runs barefoot down the stairs and into the Liverpool night.

Lost brother

John later revisits Ravenscar Asylum, the place where he was thrown
after being framed for Astra's murder. John remembers all the
maltreatment he suffered, and remembers every suffering and guilt he had
for the past years. At first it appears as though it is too much for him
and that he will be overtaken by the images of the ones he has hurt, but
the being turns into the form of a baby. This baby, who is the sum of
all his guilt and self-hatred, is then promptly thrown off a cliff near
the asylum and into the sea. After killing the creature, Constantine is
now free, and becomes even a bit more cocky and picks back up his
earlier style from the beginning of his book and his appearances from
Swamp Thing: a double-breasted blue suit underneath his trench coat, and
slicked-back gelled hair.

Later on, a Sudanese shaman who had first bound the hunger demon
Mnemoth has been having dreams of Constantine and a war-mage named
Mako who is coming to kill him and devour his being. The reason that
Constantine is a specific target of the war-mage is because he is "The
Laughing Magician" who is also known as "The Constant One." Mako wants
to devour him so he can absorb that power and have his being made a
fixture of the universe. To counter this attack to come, the African
magus puts a dream of his into a tree root, with Constantine's true
nature in those dreams. After doing this a young man is sent as a
messenger to find John and deliver the message. Constantine later
notices that something is wrong on the synchronicity lines and it seems
that he is going head first against the traffic. Remembering that Mako
mentioned Ravenscar when he found out about Constantine, he tries to
summon his unborn brother, but instead is summoned to his brother. The
soul of Constantine's brother tells John that he was not to be born and
that it should have been he who had been born instead, as he is the
Laughing Magician, he requests that he and John merge their souls so
that they become one and can fix the world, they had previously
attempted this but John was apparently too strong willed. John then
makes the link that it was the soul of his unborn brother that caused
him to get cancer and for his relationships to fail, and that anytime he
tried to take control of his life, something bad would happen to make
John weaker, so that the souls might be able to merge. After realizing
this, John cuts the soul of his brother out of his own soul, so that he
can control his life and live his way.

Later life

In the 2010s, John entangles himself in further adventures. He goes to
India and fights a ghost of a British soldier of the Sepoy
rebellion, fights a Babylonian shape shifter named Julian, gets his
thumb cut off to contact Shade: The Changing Man, marrying a young girl
named Epiphany Greaves who was also the daughter of an infamous
gangster, looking for his lost trench coat that his niece sold,
finding his sister's long lost son named Finn, and finally getting his
sister's soul from Hell.

By 2013, John was contacted by the Three Fates, who tell him that he
will finally die in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life,
John happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he
always does. When the 5th day came, John Constantine was murdered in his
own home when he was ambushed and killed by a gangster. His funeral was
attended by many of his friends and family. But it later turns out that
he had faked his death yet again. Constantine decides he should keep a
low profile, because he doesn't want to hurt the people around him
again. He bids farewell with Finn and Epiphany, and finally visits
Gemma. In the meanwhile, Gemma, hearing about her uncle's return from
the Fates, tries to kill herself with a poisonous revolver, but
Constantine sneaks the last remaining dart from his niece. Gemma says
her life will be better without him, because he takes up too much of it
and she is either hating him or loving him too much. John suggests he
leave her be, but Gemma fears he will return and put her life to misery.
John tells Gemma to make her own decision, and she reluctantly points
the revolver at him. Gemma closes her eyes before muttering, "Damn you,
John Constantine." and pulls the trigger, but when she opened her eyes
again, Constantine had vanished. The last scene shows Constantine in the
Long Journey's End bar, holding a glass of liquor with a vacant look.

The New 52

In The New 52, Constantine appears as one of the lead characters in
Justice League Dark. His history is slightly altered, such as
meeting Zatanna in New York instead of San Francisco, and the origins of
how he got his trademark trench coat. During the gap where he travels
the world to learn magic, the New 52 added the history of him meeting
Nick Necro, who was implied to be John's mentor and original owner of
the trench coat. The Forever Evil: Blight storyline would establish
that the three characters were all involved in a magical pact and a love
triangle, which fell apart due to Zatanna ending her relationship with
Nick to pursue John. Nick states "We were ALL in love, and you two shut
me out!" The character also stars in the ongoing series
Constantine, which replaces Hellblazer. He is still an unsavory
trickster in the New 52 universe, as, while during the Trinity War
between the three Justice Leagues, he tries to trick Shazam (15-year-old
Billy Batson) so that he can steal his magic. He fails, causing Billy to
become even more distrustful of other people than he already was.

In Constantine #14, it was revealed that John Constantine, as a boy,
was taught and cast his first magical spell—at the cost of the lives of
his parents and his house burning down (it was implied that his mother,
unlike in Hellblazer, survived the childbirth). It was also revealed
that he spent his childhood in the '80s in Liverpool, England (it is not
shown if he had any sibling, like Cheryl Constantine in Hellblazer). The
one who taught John his first spell was Tannarak from the Cult of the
Cold Flame (Constantine #15).

His primary enemies in Constantine are Mister E, Sargon the Sorceress
(the original Sargon's daughter), and Tannarak: all are members of the
Cult of the Cold Flame. Together with his allies Papa Midnite, the
psychic mage Spellbinder, and a witch called Julia Everheart,
Constantine attempts to destroy the Cult by conspiring a scam to take
Sargon and Tannarak by surprise. However, prior to the planned battle,
Constantine is thrown into the battlefield in Dar es Salaam in World War
I because of a ritual going wrong, making his plan ultimately fail. An
encounter with Doctor Occult there results in Constantine being
transported to Earth-2 - a world dying under siege from Darkseid and his
army of Parademons.

In Earth-2, he is assaulted by the Parademons, but Wotan comes and
rescues him, before trapping him to open a gateway to escape the dying
Earth. Constantine manages to convince Wotan to spare his life, then
works with the ancient sorcerer to open a door through his body to
Earth-0. As Wotan enters the doorway, he is split into two halves,
because there are two John Constantines in this world: the original
Constantine and the native one of Earth-2, who is surrounded by his
friends and even gets married. After the death of Wotan, Constantine
resolves to find his Earth-2 counterpart. He travels to Liverpool and
witnesses all the horror and despair of the dying world. As soon as John
reached the destination, he is shocked to find his "parents" (actually
the Earth-2 John's parents), his friends Gary Lester, Chas Chandler and
his former love interest Maureen still alive.

The Earth-2 John quickly attacks him by grabbing him in the neck, but
they are engulfed in visions of their lives in parallel right after: a
dangerous life marred with sorcery, adventures and regrets of Earth-0
John and a much quieter, much happier life of Earth-2 John. Constantine
quickly earns the trust of the Earth-2 family, who consider him to be a
wonder. Together, they escape to a warehouse where John instructs them
to draw sigils to cast a complex spell. As John is lecturing about the
unpredictability and the price of magic, Doctor Fate appears in front of
his eyes, claims to have foreseen his arrival and offers to help him.

Doctor Fate reminds John of an incoming horde of Parademons and tells
him to quickly cast the spell to escape from the dying world, himself
hoping to flee with John and the family too. John discovers that the
spell requires one Constantine dies: either himself or the Earth-2 John.
As the Parademons storm in and take each family member down one by one,
John is torn over between saving his own life and let the good, honest
Earth-2 John live by sacrificing himself. Finally, he chooses to save
his own skin: as he is kissing the other John, he holds his hand and
drives the knife into his heart, ultimately kills the "other John". As
the spells start working, John casts an additional spell to trick Doctor
Fate, which masks his presence from the ancient sorcerer, then departs,
brings along the family members and many other people.

By killing the "proper" Constantine, he earns the wrath and hatred of
the Earth-2 family. Being called "Devil", John corrects the family when
they reach Heaven while peeling through the layers of the dying world:
Heaven itself, also under assault from Darkseid's force, has closed its
door and started departing, deems this world beyond salvation. Later,
John and his entourage are attacked by Doctor Fate, who manages to
detect Constantine's whereabout. Despite succeeding in countering the
assault, John loses his "mother" Mary-Anne, who is dragged back by
Fate's chain. This greatly traumatizes Thomas Constantine, John's
father, who even attempts to commit suicide, but is talked out of it by
John.

After a long and hard trip, Constantine finally makes it back home, but
Darkseid has sensed him and is in hot pursuit. As the menacing hand of
the Apokolips God is reaching to him, Constantine enacts his "last
trick": by sacrificing some souls of his entourage, John manages to get
enough power to cast the "Ring of Dolus" spell, which uses every happy
memories, every pleasant thought, every piece of hope in John
Constantine to swirl a magical "web" made of lies. This powerful spell
helps John projecting an illusion of an already dead universe to fool
Darkseid, while John manages to bring himself, the family and the
Earth-2 civilians to safety - he even pickpockets some survivors back
from Darkseid's clutch.

As Constantine lands in the Jurassic Coast, England, he is confronted by
Thomas, who points a gun at his head. Tired of everything, John yells at
his father, begs him to kill him off for good. Unable to do it, Thomas
drops his gun, but Maureen quickly puts it up and prepares to shoot John
while questioning his actions. John contemplates and sees that he is no
hero, but he is the only one willing to sacrifice "proper John" to save
his family, or trade a hundred people for the safety of six billion. He
magically teleports away, leaves the family and the survivors behind.
Later, John goes back to New York and visits his old friend Lloyd at his
bar to tell him about his latest adventures.

The New 52 Constantine series ends at issue #23 and will be relaunched
as Constantine: The Hellblazer written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion
IV in June 2015.

The Constantine Futures End tie-in tells the story of John Constantine
five years into a possible future of the New 52 universe. He somehow
obtains the ultimate occult artifact, the Helmet of Fate, and manages to
trick and kill the ancient magician Nabu with the help of an old ifrit.

John Constantine's origin in the New 52 universe is seemingly retconned
in the Secret Origins series. In the story, a group of kids in Liverpool
manages to get their hands on an occult book and uses it to summon a
magical creature called Legendbreaker to discover Constantine's true
origin. Instead, the creature tells three conflicting stories: one
featuring John's mother dead in childbirth, leaving him to his abusive
father; another have John Constantine being born in a loving family with
proud and doting parents; the last one is a John born in an unremarkable
family, but his older sister is mad and (probably) possessed by a dark
force. They all lead to the death of his entire family and set the path
for John Constantine into the world of magic, to the fateful incident in
Newcastle, albeit the actions and consequences are different. The
creature tries to claim the souls of the young "mystics", but the real
John Constantine shows up and chases it away. He tells the kids to go
back home, forget what has just happened, and his true origins will
forever remain unknown - but it does not matter.


Appearances and mentions

John Constantine appears in an early issue of Neil Gaiman's The
Sandman. There in 1989, he helps Dream recover a pouch of sand which
had served as one of Dream's totems of power. John had purchased the
pouch during Dream's imprisonment and it had then been stolen from him
by an ex-girlfriend. John and Dream find the woman using the sand as a
drug and driven mad by it. Dream recovers the pouch, granting the woman
a peaceful death at John's request and promising to end the nightmares
John had been having "ever since Newcastle". John's ancestor Lady
Johanna Constantine also plays a significant role in storylines of The
Sandman and an Elizabethan-era "Jack Constantine" is mentioned.

In another of Gaiman's comics, The Books of Magic, John is at hand to
show the hero Timothy Hunter around the then-present day 
Universe, along with Mister E, Doctor Occult and the Phantom Stranger.
He later appears several times in both the monthly "Books of Magic"
series and several mini and maxiseries featuring Timothy Hunter.

During a crossover, Constantine met Shade, The Changing Man during the
Hotel Shade era, by Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo. Constantine also
makes a small cameo in Vertigo's Lucifer. In issue No. 5 he is seen
drinking at Lucifer Morningstar's bar Lux, among guests that seek an
audience with Lucifer about the gateway to the void outside of creation.
According to himself he's not there to propose a trade with Lucifer,
only to take "a quick look at the field". Lucifer Morningstar makes
a return cameo in Hellblazer No. 192. Lucifer writer Mike Carey
wrote Hellblazer between issues 175–215.

Constantine is one of the few people aware of the Crisis on Infinite
Earths, and one of the few to have foreseen it. Although longtime
allies Zatanna, the Phantom Stranger and Swamp Thing are still either
active or frequently referred to in the U's world of superheroics, the
world of Hellblazer became more realistic and no mention was made of
John's interactions with superheroes, which included attending the
funeral of Hal Jordan uninvited, drinking with Doom Patrol member Mento,
meeting Batman, attending the opening of Guy Gardner's Green Lantern
theme bar, helping an incarnation of the Challengers of the Unknown save
London from one of the Millennium Giants and, in his own comic, playing
host to a stoned Zatanna at his fortieth birthday party. He does
complain about superheroes not getting in trouble for collateral damage
as he does at the beginning of The Fear Machine story arc.
Constantine was slated to be a main character of the aborted
company-wide crossover Twilight of the Superheroes, however the
project was ultimately shelved.

John Constantine can be seen in a panel in Neil Gaiman's Batman: Secret
Origins story "When is a Door". In it, a film crew is asking people on
the street what they think of Gotham's super-villain problem, John is
shown smoking a cigarette, responding "Sorry squire, I'm not from 'round
here' make that "no comment."" Though it is not stated that this is
Constantine, he has the same appearance, speaks in a decidedly British
fashion, and this would not be the first cameo Gaiman has given him in a
comic. The story was later reprinted as an extra in Gaiman's "Whatever
Happened to the Caped Crusader". He briefly met Oliver Queen in a London
pub, telling him to mention his name to the dark forces in Sherwood
Forest, although Queen ignored the request.

While not seen in the Justice League Unlimited comic books he was
mentioned. He also rates a mention along with Swamp Thing as unavailable
in The Spectre (vol. 2) No. 11 (a crossover with Millennium, to
which he alluded in Swamp Thing, trying to get the latter to assist).
Constantine appeared in the pages of Justice League of America: Wedding
Special, during the bachelor party of Green Arrow. He was walking
behind Metamorpho during a conversation between Hal Jordan and John
Stewart.

In the final issue of the Brightest Day series, Constantine appears on
the last page, remarking "Bollocks" at news that a new Swamp Thing has
appeared. Constantine starred in Brightest Day Aftermath: The Search
For Swamp Thing, a three-issue mini-series that saw John interact with
various  superheroes during his pursuit of the new Swamp Thing. 
Co-Publisher Dan DiDio stated that the John Constantine in the 
Universe will be closer to his original incarnation while Constantine in
Vertigo's Hellblazer would continue unaffected.

After Swamp Thing's resurrection by the White Lantern, Constantine is
shown looking over the bodies of the polluting executives Swamp Thing
has just killed.


Other Versions

-   John Constantine debuted in the Injustice: Gods Among Us Year
    Three comic series as Batman's newest ally against Superman, written
    by Tom Taylor. He takes part in the war to protect his illegitimate
    daughter Rose, whose "parents" are killed in the crossfire of the
    war between the Green Lantern Corp - Batman allies and the joint
    force of Superman and Sinestro Corp. He hides Rose inside the Tower
    of Fate, which resides in a separate magical realm, and proceed to
    strike a deal with Trigon, then recruit Detective Chimp and other
    magical characters including Klarion the Witch Boy and Etrigan the
    Demon. Together, he has to face a new enemy who allies himself to
    Superman's side: The Spectre (who is later revealed to no longer
    reside in Jim Corrigan, but Mister Mxyzptlk). Later on, John
    Constantine unsuccessfully attempts to recruit Swamp Thing, who
    cites Superman and Luthor's efforts in protecting the environment as
    a reason to join the Regime's side. When Superman's force attacks
    Batman's hideout, the Tower of Fate, Constantine summons Trigon to
    attack Superman and allow Batman's team time to escape to the House
    of Mystery. Trigon wreaks havoc inside the Tower, but he is stopped
    by Mister Mxyzptlk, who proves to be a real match to Trigon. Their
    magical battle leads them to the House of Mystery's location, where
    resulting raging hellfire and magical vortex from the duel threaten
    to destroy both sides. Batman's team chooses to reside in the House
    of Mystery while Superman's team regroup in the House of Secret, but
    with the Man of Steel greatly weakened by the magic. Doctor Fate
    offers a solution: he will use the power from Billy Batson's Shazam
    lightning to cast a spell to banish both Trigon and Mxyzptlk to
    "the Void". The plan is successful, but everyone is knocked out
    before Zatanna arrives and transports Team Batman away to another
    hideout, while Doctor Fate himself disappears along with the two
    magical powerhouses. It is finally revealed that all of John's
    involvement in the war is only to get rid of Trigon, which will
    ensure his daughter Rose's safety. He states however that he
    actually does hate Superman then recommends Batman start "thinking
    outside the box". He finally "magically relocates" with Rose and
    leaves a puzzled Batman behind.

-   The Earth-2 version of John Constantine appears in Earth-2
    World's End. John Constantine was a Liverpool native who spent his
    youth in a rock band alongside his life long friends Chas Chandler
    and Gaz. Eventually, he settled down, marrying Maureen and retired
    to Liverpool. On his 30th birthday, John and his friends decided to
    brave through the invasion of their world by the aliens of Apokolips
    to celebrate at the local pub. During their celebration, however,
    John was weakened by the magic battle being held by the John
    Constantine of Prime Earth who had traveled between their worlds-
    causing him to pass out, overheat and hallucinate. The Prime Earth
    John had tricked the Wizard Wotan into trying to use him as a door
    while forgetting that a second John Constantine existed in Earth 2,
    causing Wotan to be torn in two between the Prime Earth and Earth 2
    Constantines, splitting him in half, with the dismembered chest and
    head of the wizard falling out of the unconscious John, much to the
    horror of his friends and Maureen. When the Prime Earth Constantine
    found his way to John's home in Liverpool, John attacked him in a
    fury, and in the ensuing struggle, awoke each other's memories in
    the other. Realizing that he's not a trick of Apokolips, John
    vouched for the alien Constantine, explaining to his family and
    friends that he's just a different John from a different universe,
    and that his magic made him a Wonder who could take them from Earth
    2 to the safety of his home world. Before they could commit to
    anything, a pack of mindless looters, driven mad by the Apokolips
    signal, attacked John's house, forcing them to make a run for it
    through the streets of Liverpool. When one of the looters drew a gun
    on Constantine, the Earth Prime John jumped in front of the shot,
    protecting him. Taking shelter in an abandoned brick factory, where
    the Prime Earth John began to teach them to spread magic symbols
    across the factory to disguise themselves from the Parademons and
    prepare to take them across space to escape the dying Earth 2.
    Despite their attempts to keep their magic to themselves, the
    Constantine's spell circles attracted the attention of Doctor Fate,
    who explained that the only way the Prime Earth John could power the
    spell would be to enslave himself to Fate in the future and
    increasing his power, or by killing the Earth 2 Constantine. The
    Prime Earth Constantine explained that John's soul was preventing
    him from completing the ritual, and convinced him to sacrifice
    himself for the good of his family, allowing John to stab him
    through the heart during a kiss goodbye, dying so that Maureen, Chas
    and his parents could live to see another day on Prime Earth.

-   John Constantine appears in the Smallville Season Eleven comic. He
    appears in the story arc, "Harbinger." When Zatanna Zatara is
    attacked by a man, John interferes and knocks the man out. He then
    introduces himself and offers her a cigarette. Zatanna and
    Constantine arrive at his place of business, which appears to be a
    black market of cursed items. He informs her that the Book of Magic
    she's looking for, which used to be in her father's possession, was
    stolen from him by a group of cultists just like the one they
    encountered, the Church of Blood. Zatanna says that the acolyte she
    fought with was already very powerful and John says that they must
    be planning something big. John also says that he wants the book
    because he intends to sell it to collectors but Zatanna says that
    the book belonged to her father, from which he got all his spells,
    so she won't let him have it. She needs to find the book of Magick
    and destroy it like she did with all the other items he had cursed.
    Constantine then says that she can't battle with all these men from
    the cult on her own and that she needs help to do so. The two form
    an uneasy partnership, even though they still disagree about who
    will take the book at the end. Following an abduction of a teenage
    girl by the cult, Zatanna and John Constantine are closing in on the
    Church of Blood, who is preparing a final sacrifice at Stonehenge to
    bring the demon Trigon to Earth. They arrive moments before the cult
    appears ready to kill the girl. Just as Brother Blood, the leader,
    raises his ceremonial dagger, John and Zatanna descend from the sky.
    They succeed to prevent the girl's sacrifice with Constantine
    attacking the cult members but suddenly Brother Blood reveals that
    he was the true sacrifice all along and then stabs himself in
    the heart. While demons claw their way out of Brother Blood's body,
    Constantine grabs the Book of Magic and makes off with it,
    abandoning Zatanna and the girl to deal with the demons on
    their own. With no other options, the two run from the
    attacking demons. Constantine retreats to a nearby truck as Zatanna
    is left alone with the girl at Stonehenge to face the demons. The
    ghosts of those he's let die in the past watch him accusingly, but
    he insists he doesn't care about leaving her and the girl behind.
    Constantine eventually has a change of heart and hurries back to
    Brother Blood's body. He reaches inside the slain man's opened chest
    to extract one of his organs. Then he recites an exorcism spell that
    banishes the demons back to the pits of Hell from whence they came,
    saving both their lives. Later, Zatanna meets Constantine at one of
    the bars and she thanks him for not letting her die. She also tells
    him that she considers D.E.O.'s offer to become a consultant and
    John says that now that she doesn't have to search for any other
    cursed objects of her father's she is free to do what she wants. He
    then gives her back the Book of Magic, deciding not to sell it, and
    takes his leave through a closet. When Constantine returns at his
    flat in London, two D.E.A. agents meet him at the door saying they'd
    like a word with him. Constantine promptly turns them into frogs and
    collects their badges in a bucket already containing quite a few
    other police badges.


Analogues

-   The character of Jack Carter in Warren Ellis and John Cassaday's
    comic book series Planetary is an analogue of John
    Constantine; he fakes his death and turns into an analogue
    of Ellis' Spider Jerusalem, stating that with the 1980s over, it's
    "time to be someone else": this has been interpreted as Ellis
    criticising the Constantine character for being too tied to his
    origins as a reaction to 1980s politics and stating that more modern
    characters have since taken on his mantle.
-   Constance Johanssen, a blonde, chain-smoking British woman in a
    trenchcoat was also created by Ellis for his Pryde and Wisdom
    series for , described as "Constance Johanssen.
    Excellent occult detective. Has a habit of getting her
    friends killed. Two hundred at last count."

-   A Mite version of John Constantine appeared in Batman:
    Mitefall.
-   Grant Morrison originally wanted Constantine to become a supporting
    character in his Doom Patrol series, but 's editorial policy at
    the time prevented Constantine from making extended appearances in
    superhero comics, for fear of spoiling the realism of Hellblazer.
    As a result, Morrison created the magus Willoughby Kipling. It
    was revealed in Hellblazer No. 51 that he and Constantine have
    met, and he had a brief voice-over cameo in Warren Ellis' JLA:
    Classified story "New Maps of Hell".
-   Ambrose Bierce is the name of a character intended to be John
    Constantine in Phil Foglio's Stanley and His Monster limited
    series, but changed at the last minute due to editorial policy.
    Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin played a similar role for Firestorm and
    Captain Atom as Constantine did for Swamp Thing, while Hellblazer
    was a Jack Kirby-style reinterpretation of the character who
    appeared in Doom Patrol and The Books of Magic.
-   According to actor Misha Collins, the wardrobe of the character
    Castiel on the TV show Supernatural is based on that of John
    Constantine.

-   In the CrossGen title Mystic No. 15, magical characters from
    different literature, including  and 's sorcerers, made some
    appearances in a bar. John Constantine appears in the
    background.
-   A reference to him was made in the  universe in Hellstorm No.
    2, where a full description of Constantine was made by Doctor
    Strange and Hellstorm while sitting and talking in a bar. Hellstorm
    described him as a Brit who "smokes like a fiend."


Influences

Hellblazer boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective
fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples
of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, The
Originals, Felix Castor, and The Dresden Files have been influenced
by the character. Many imitators of both the series and its
character flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary,
and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times
in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have
appeared.


Powers and abilities

Unlike most comic book magicians, Constantine rarely uses magical
spells, unless he has to, especially in combat. Constantine faces most
of his challenges relying primarily on his cunning, quick-thinking
during fights, vast knowledge of the occult, manipulation of opponents
and allies, and an extensive list of contacts. These skills are often
more useful than his magical ones. He is known to have deceived many of
the most powerful beings in the  Universe, such as The First of the
Fallen and The Presence, as well as manipulating Batman and
Superman. He is considered by many as being the world's greatest con
man. Constantine is also one of a few people knowing all the routes
to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife, which he uses to escape and teleport
without the danger of being chased by enemies. In the graphic novel
Pandemonium, he once allowed himself to be killed, but later
resurrects himself by exiting the afterlife.

As a sorcerer, Constantine is armed with the knowledge of many magical
spells, rituals, and curses, such as evocation, necromancy, illusions,
invisibility, and can even use magic to time travel. He also has
a wide range of protection magic such as sigils and magic circles that
can protect him from both physical and supernatural attacks. But
John's most signature ability is synchronicity wave travelling, which is
an instinctual supernatural ability for Constantine to make his own
luck. This has led John to uncanny luck at games of chance, the ability
to avoid and escape harm, meet the right kind of ally to help prevent or
stop an apocalyptic event from happening, and reshape the battle he's
fighting to his own accord. Constantine is also highly resistant to
many psychic attacks such as telepathy, possessions, and mind control.
He can even use magic to block off omnipresence, seen where he once used
sigils to hide himself from the First of the Fallen. By the New 52,
other magical powers such as mild teleportation, counter spells,
elemental magic, telekinesis, and immobilisation have
been added. He can also use magic to reflect damages done to him onto
his enemies.

Aside from sorcery, Constantine has also exhibited considerable mastery
in "stage magic skills"—hypnosis, sleight of hand, pick pocketing and
escapology. John also carries with him an arsenal of powerful magical
artifacts to aid him in battle, such as The House of Mystery which also
serves as his transport to different realms of the universe, and his
trademark trench coat that also possesses powerful demonic powers.
Ever since tricking the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer, he
was perpetually in good health and physicality. Constantine's blood is
demonically tainted, initially by a blood transfusion from the demon
Nergal, and later by sex with a succubus. His blood has been shown to
have healing properties, and is noted to have an age-managing
effect. It also acted as a defence mechanism when attacked by the
King of the Vampires, as it is highly corrosive and poisonous.
Constantine's skill at unarmed combat varies depending on the writer.
Some portray him as a poor physical fighter, others as a capable
hand-to-hand combatant. Over time he has won occasional fights using
magical weapons, by fighting dirty, or by quick-thinking.


In real life

Alan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he
told Wizard Magazine:

His second meeting with his creation was illustrated in 2001's Snakes
and Ladders, an adaptation by Eddie Campbell of one of Moore's
performance art pieces:

They met a third time in fiction, when Moore was written into issue No.
120 of Hellblazer by then-author Paul Jenkins. Moore is seen sitting in
silhouette at the back of a bar as John Constantine (who is on a pub
crawl with the reader) raises a drink to him.

Writers who had their run on the Hellblazer series have also admitted
meeting the character in real life. Original Hellblazer writer, Jamie
Delano also claims to have encountered Constantine, during his run on
the character, outside the British Museum. Peter Milligan saw
Constantine at a party around 2009 and rushed after him, only to find
he'd disappeared. Brian Azzarello once saw him in a Chicago bar but
avoided him, saying that "the thing is about John is, the last thing
you'd want to be is his friend."


Reception

The character won the 1986 "Favourite Supporting Character" by Eagle
Award, followed by winning it again in the same category a year
later. In addition to being ranked third in Empire magazine's 50
Greatest Comic Characters and being ranked No. 10 in Wizard Magazine's
Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, he is also listed in IGN's
Top 100 Comic Book Heroes as No. 29, stating that "John Constantine is
pretty low on the totem pole as far as 's magical players go. But
through a combination of guile, trickery, and plain old ornery charm,
Constantine battles the worst Hell has to offer and lives to tell the
tale. Constantine is a byproduct of both the punk rock era and Margaret
Thatcher's Britain. He isn't very nice, he drinks and smokes like
they're both going out of style, and his friends always seem to pay for
his own magical misdeeds. And yet we can't help but love this crusty old
magician all the same." Watchmojo listed Constantine in its Top
10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked
Constantine as #30 on their list of the "50 Sexiest Male Characters in
Comics".

The character also garnered some negative reception, where UGO.com
listed both Constantine and Zatanna in UGO's the Dirtiest Comic Book Sex
Scenes, where they comment that, "One  heroine who often finds herself
unlucky in love is the backwards magician Zatanna, who can never seem to
find a quality dude. One of the most fulfilling relationships she's had
to date is with that reprobate John Constantine, who is the very
definition of a "love 'em and leave 'em" kind of dude. The pair hooked
up a number of times but their respective worldviews were just too
different, plus he's straight Vertigo and she's wiping minds in the
Justice League. The commute would be hideous." During Brian
Azzarello's run on the series, the Ashes & Dust in the City of Angels
story arc gained controversy for portraying Constantine in a bisexual
relationship, though it wouldn't be the last time Constantine's
bisexuality was explored.

Fandomania.com ranked the film Constantine in No. 13 of their Ultimate
20 Comic Book Film Adaptations, stating that Keanu Reeves's performance
"was good", although saying it might have been better if "played by the
person the character was originally modelled after: Sting of the
Police." TopTenz.net ranked him No. 5 in Top 10 Comic Book
Anti-Heroes, saying that "Just knowing John Constantine is likely to get
you killed: during his comic's run just about every member of his
supporting cast has either been killed, maimed, mutilated, tortured and
coerced into making deals with fiends from the Pit. And yet Constantine
goes on, a supernatural warrior willing to pay almost any price to keep
the darkest evil at bay. In recent times Constantine has got rid of the
guilt and self-loathing plaguing him by magically giving it the physical
form of a baby and throwing it off a cliff. What a magnificent
bastard..."

Sonia Harris from Comics Should Be Good praised Hellblazer, saying
that "watching John delve into his past in order to exorcise his (and
the worlds) literal and metaphorical demons is a delight. Simon Bisley
does an incredible job of visually contrasting the pretty young version
of Constantine with the imposing man he has become. Time and
misadventure have scarred and hardened John, and the man he has become
has the strength and will to transform his environment by channelling
the anger that pained him so much as a young, fresh-faced, suicidal punk
kid." Constantine ranked 30th on ComicsAlliance's 50 Sexiest Male
Characters in Comics list that even though almost all of his
relationships end badly, they can't warn others against his wily charms.


In other media

Films

Constantine

[Keanu Reeves as John Constantine in the 2005 film Constantine.] John
Constantine appeared in the 2005 film Constantine portrayed by Keanu
Reeves. The film used some elements from Garth Ennis' "Dangerous Habits"
story arc (issues No. 41–46) and others—such as the inclusion of
Papa Midnite—from the "Original Sins" trade paperback. The film
changed several aspects of the source material, however, including a
number of cosmetic changes to the lead character, e.g., his name is
spoken as "constan-teen", and Reeves played the role with his natural
accent and hair colour, as well as the film basing him in Los Angeles
(although the director pointed out that the comic book was not
exclusively set in London either). Other differences to the comic
were made, for example giving him a psychic ability to see "half breeds"
as they truly are—a curse that caused him to attempt suicide which in
turn damned him to Hell. He was also given the ability to render
invisible beings in his proximity visible by using the incantation "Into
the light I command thee" and two magical glyphs (called "The Perfect
Red King" from Eugenius Philalethes's "The Speculum Veritatis") on his
arms to combine, which he uses to uncloak the archangel Gabriel directly
after he attacked his friend Chas. Unlike the comic version,
Constantine's exorcism tools are primarily based on Christian relics
rather than generic supernatural items; the novelisation expanded on
this by explaining that, as Constantine comes from a Christian culture,
he has a greater natural understanding of the power of Christian relics
that makes it easier for him to use them. Constantine's exorcisms are
motivated by a desire to redeem himself for his past suicide, yet they
are constantly doomed to fail as everything he has done has
fundamentally been for his own benefit rather than for the selfless
betterment of others. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the
film was also amended, with Lucifer saving the redeemed Constantine to
give him a second chance at failing after Constantine willingly
sacrificed a chance to save his own life to ask Satan to send the
innocent Isabel Dodson to Heaven (Isabel having committed suicide to
prevent herself being used as a host for a demonic incursion).

Television

[Matt Ryan as John Constantine in the NBC series Constantine
(2014-2015).]

-   A live action Constantine TV series was developed for NBC with
    Daniel Cerone and David S. Goyer writing and executive producing the
    series. Welsh actor Matt Ryan was cast in the title role,
    for which he adopted Constantine's blond hair and an English accent.
    The show, which lasted thirteen episodes before cancellation,
    followed John's journeys across America alongside his friend Chas
    and a young woman named Zed who is being hunted down by a demon.
    Along the way, he solves supernatural mysteries, vanquishes demons,
    and clashes with officious angels sent to watch over him. A decision
    not to explore Constantine's bisexuality in the show caused some
    consternation with fans, although the character continued to be
    portrayed as bisexual in the comics.
-   Following the show's cancellation, a crossover episode with the TV
    show Arrow aired, with Matt Ryan reprising the role as Constantine
    guest starring in the episode, "Haunted". In flashbacks, he first
    meets Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) on the island Lian Yu where he
    introduces Oliver to magic and gives him a tattoo for magical
    protection after Oliver saves his life. In the present-day
    narrative, Oliver calls in a favour from John, five years later, and
    John helps Oliver restore the soul of his friend Sara Lance (Caity
    Lotz) after she is resurrected by the Lazarus Pit a year after
    her murder. In the episode, "Taken," when asked if they can call in
    Constantine to help save William and battle Damien Darhk's magic,
    Oliver mentions that he's literally in Hell.

Video games

-   THQ released a video game film tie-in of the film entitled
    Constantine. An analogue of the character made an appearance
    in The Golden Dawn, a Call of Cthulu RPG book by John Tynes,
    John T. Snyder, Garrie Hall and Alan Smithee. The authors
    recommended Hellblazer in the book.
-   John Constantine also appeared in the MMORPG  Universe Online.
    In the heroes side, he resides within the Hero Garrison in the
    Gotham Wastelands. He must be talked to for the Wrath daily
    missions, while in the villains side he is random boss in the
    Cathedral duo for Villains.
-   In Batman: Arkham Knight, there is an office front for John
    Constantine on Founder's Island.

Books

The noir fiction author John Shirley is credited in writing three
Hellblazer novels, including the novelisation of the Constantine film.
The novel Hellblazer: War Lord features Constantine talking about
"another John Constantine in an alternate universe, [who] has black hair
and lives most of his life in Los Angeles" whilst giving a brief summary
of the film's plot.

Toys

 Direct created a toyline of John which is more related to his comic
book appearance. Another action figure toy line was created by 
Heroclix, which resembles the Constantine in The New 52. Film tie-in
merchandise of the film were also released.

Music

The song "Stranger in the Mirror" by Ookla the Mok is written from
Constantine's point of view, including a lyrical reference to 'the
Newcastle incident'.
