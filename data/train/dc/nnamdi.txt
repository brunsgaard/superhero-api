Fictional character biography

The current leader of Gorilla City, Nnamdi is nominated to succeed his
father after Solovar is assassinated and his cousin Ulgo is used as a
pawn in a scheme to start a war between humans and the super-simians of
Gorilla City. Under Nnamdi, Gorilla City has blended its advanced
technology with the nature around it and adopted a more isolationist
policy than was present during Solovar's reign, as seen in Nnamdi's
refusal to allow the Flash to imprison Grodd for his crimes after Flash
defeated him, even erasing Wally's memory of the city's location to stop
him finding them again (Flash v.2 #194, 2003).
