Fictional character biography

When Travis Morgan the Warlord encountered a lovely young woman in
Skartaris captured by the evil Titans that lived on the Isle of Titans,
he freed her. Calling herself Shakira, the former captive revealed a
surprise for her rescuer. The Warlord was shocked to find that his
damsel in distress was a feline shapeshifter.

When he saved her from savage bird-men, Shakira became his ally. She set
about repaying the favor when she shapeshifted her way out of a robot's
trap that had ensnared both her and Morgan, and destroyed their
mechanical torturer with its own laser weapons. Warlord asked Shakira if
she was a woman who became a cat or a cat who became a woman, but she
never gave him an answer. In the strange world of Skartaris,
Shakira has become Morgan's constant companion and a trusted friend.

    fear of water.

    shot with most firearms.
