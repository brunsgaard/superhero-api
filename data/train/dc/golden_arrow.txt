GOLDEN ARROW is a fictional character who had his own strip in Fawcett
Comics' Whiz Comics comic book series, from 1940 to 1953.


Fictional character history

The hero was originally Roger Parsons, the son of inventor Paul Parsons,
who had developed a new type of gas for transportation by balloon. A
greedy competitor, Brand Braddock, plotted to stop Mr. Parsons, and did
so by shooting down a balloon Parsons was using to test the formula. Mr.
Parsons, his wife Gloria, and his son Roger were all aboard the balloon.
The two adults died when the balloon crashed in a sparsely populated
area of the Western United States, while the baby miraculously
survived.

An old prospector named Nugget Ned raised the child as his own, teaching
him to fend for himself and developing the boy into a skilled archer. On
his deathbed, the old man told the now-grown boy of his origins, and the
young man, calling himself "Golden Arrow", set out, with the help of his
stallion White Wind, to avenge his father and right other wrongs
throughout the West

Although the comic appeared to be set in the Old West, in Whiz Comics
#43 Golden Arrow had an adventure with Captain  and Spy Smasher,
which would indicate that the setting was actually contemporary.
