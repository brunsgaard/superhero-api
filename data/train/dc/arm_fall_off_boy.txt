Biography

Arm Fall Off Boy has the ability to detach his own limbs, which he can
then use as blunt weapons. His background is not explored in his initial
appearances; in Legionnaires (vol 4) #12, Matter-Eater Lad claims he
gained his powers through carelessness while holding the anti-gravity
metal Element 152, but Matter-Eater Lad may not have been serious. In
his introduction, he is an applicant at the first Legion tryout, and the
first Legion reject.

Following the Zero Hour reboot, the character appears again in
Legionnaires (vol. 4) #43 and is identified as Floyd Belkin of the
planet Lallor. Under the name Splitter, Floyd participates in the
Legion's tryouts in Legionnaires #43 and is one of five finalists, but
he is denied Legion membership after he panics and literally falls apart
during the last test. Later in the comic, he appears as a member of the
Heroes of Lallor.
