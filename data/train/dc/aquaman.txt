AQUAMAN is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
published by . Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the
character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially
a backup feature in 's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in
several volumes of a solo title. During the late 1950s and 1960s
superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding
member of the Justice League of America. In the 1990s Modern Age,
Aquaman's character became more serious than in most previous
interpretations, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as
king of Atlantis.

Aquaman has been adapted for screen many times, first appearing in
animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and
then in the related Super Friends program. Since then he has appeared
in various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s
series Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold,
as well as several  Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor Alan
Ritchson also portrayed the role in live action in the television show
Smallville. Jason Momoa portrayed the character in the 2016 film
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and will reprise his role in
the  Extended Universe, including a solo film in 2018.

The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting
impression, meaning Aquaman is widely recognised in popular culture.
Jokes about his wholesome portrayal in Super Friends and perceived
weaker powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programmes and
stand-up routines, leading  at several times to attempt to make the
character edgier or more powerful in comic books. Modern comic book
depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his
public perception, casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, saddled with
an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond
his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.


Fictional character biography

Golden Age

Aquaman's first origin story was presented in flashback from his debut
in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941), narrated by the character
himself:

In his early Golden Age appearances, Aquaman can breathe underwater and
control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute. Initially, he
was depicted as speaking to sea creatures "in their own language" rather
than telepathically, and only when they were close enough to hear him
(within a 20-yard radius). Aquaman's adventures took place all across
the world, and his base was "a wrecked fishing boat kept underwater," in
which he lived.

During his wartime adventures, most of Aquaman's foes were Nazi U-boat
commanders and various Axis villains. The rest of his adventures in the
1940s and 1950s had him dealing with various sea-based criminals,
including modern-day pirates such as his longtime archenemy Black Jack,
as well as various threats to aquatic life, shipping lanes, and sailors.

Aquaman's last appearance in More Fun Comics was in issue #107, before
being moved along with Superboy and Green Arrow to Adventure Comics,
starting with issue #103 in 1946.

Silver Age

Aquaman's adventures continued to be published in Adventure Comics
through the 1940s and 1950s, as one of the few superheroes to last
through the 1950s in continuous publication. Starting in the late 1950s,
new elements to Aquaman's backstory were introduced, with various new
supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the
character, his origins, his powers, and persona. The first of these
elements was the story "Aquaman's Undersea Partner" in Adventure
Comics #229 (October 1956), where his octopus sidekick, Topo, was first
introduced. This and subsequent elements were later, after the
establishment of 's multiverse in the 1960s, and attributed to the
Aquaman of Earth-One.

In Adventure Comics #260 (May 1959) and subsequent Silver Age comics,
it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a
lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost,
underwater city of Atlantis. Due to his heritage, Aquaman discovers as a
youth that he possesses various superhuman abilities, including the
powers of surviving underwater, communication with sea life, and
tremendous swimming prowess. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his
talents to become the defender of the Earth's oceans. It was later
revealed that he had, in his youth, adventured as Aquaboy and one
occasion, met Superboy, Earth's only other publicly active superpowered
hero at the time. When Arthur grew up, he called himself "Aquaman".

It was later revealed that after Atlanna's death, Tom Curry met and
married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman's
half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his
brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew
to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess but
also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman.
Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years
later as Aquaman's nemesis, Ocean Master.

Aquaman's ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full-fledged
telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances.
He was also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to
Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern's vulnerability
to the color yellow: Aquaman had to come into contact with water at
least once per hour, or he would die (prior to this story Aquaman could
exist both in and out of water indefinitely.)

Allies and foes

Aquaman was included in the Justice League of America comic book
series, appearing with the team in their very first adventure, and
was also a founding member of the team. Aquaman took part in most of
the 1960s adventures of the superhero team.

Aquaman's supporting cast and rogues gallery soon began to grow with the
addition of Aqualad, an outcast, orphaned youth from an Atlantean colony
whom Aquaman takes in and begins to mentor. Aquaman later discovered
the submerged fictional city of New Venice, and which also becomes
Aquaman's base of operations for a time.

Aquaman is recognized as the son of Atlanna and is later voted to be the
King after the death of the former regent, who has no heirs. By this
time Aquaman had met Mera, a queen from a water-based dimension, and
marries her shortly after he had become king. They soon have a son,
Arthur, Jr. (nicknamed "Aquababy").

The 1960s series introduced other such archenemies as the Ocean Master
(Aquaman's amnesiac half-brother Orm), Black Manta, the
Fisherman, the Scavenger, and the terrorist organization known
as O.G.R.E.. Other recurring members of the Aquaman cast introduced
in this series include the well-meaning but annoying Quisp (a water
sprite); Dr. Vulko, a trustworthy Atlantean scientist who became
Aquaman's royal adviser and whom Aquaman eventually appoints to be king
after leaving the throne himself; and Tula (known as "Aquagirl"), an
Atlantean princess who was Aqualad's primary love interest.

End of an era

In the mid-1980s, after his own feature's demise, Aquaman is briefly
made the leader of the Justice League of America. In a storyline in
Justice League of America #228-230 , an invasion of Earth by a race of
Martians occurs at a time when the core members are missing. Aquaman is
thus forced to defend Earth with a League much-depleted in power and
capability, and he takes it upon himself to disband the Justice League
altogether in Justice League of America Annual #2 (1984), thereafter
reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full
participation to the League's cases. With the help of Martian Manhunter,
Zatanna, and Elongated Man, veteran Justice League members willing to
fully commit to the team, Aquaman recruits and trains four new and
untried members, Gypsy, Vibe, Vixen, and Steel, also relocating the
team's headquarters to a reinforced bunker in Detroit, Michigan after
the destruction of the JLA's satellite headquarters during the
invasion. Aquaman's participation in this new version of the Justice
League ended in #243 (Oct. 1985), when he resigns to work on his
marriage with Mera.

Modern Age

[The deep-blue camouflage costume, from Aquaman vol. 2, #1 (Feb.
1986). Art by Craig Hamilton.] After the 1985 Crisis on Infinite
Earths miniseries, several short miniseries were produced in the late
1980s and early 1990s, beginning with 1986's four-issue Aquaman (Feb.
â€“ May 1986), written by Neal Pozner, and featuring Aquaman in a new,
largely deep-sea blue, costume. The series was well received and a
follow up limited series was in the works, though it was eventually
canceled due to creative problems. This series also expanded on
several details of the Silver Age Aquaman's origin as well as Aquaman's
relationship with his half-brother, Ocean Master, whose origin was
retold in more complete detail. The series also added mystical elements
to Aquaman's mythology and reinvented Ocean Master as a sorcerer.
Aquaman reappeared in his blue costume in the Aquaman Special #1
(1988).

In late 1988, the character appeared in the "Invasion!" storyline, guest
starring with the Doom Patrol, again in the orange and green costume.

Retelling origins

In 1989, the Legend of Aquaman Special (officially titled as Aquaman
Special #1 in the comic's legal indicia, the second Special in
back-to-back years) rewrote Aquaman's mythos and origin, though keeping
most of his Silver Age history intact. The special was by writer Robert
Loren Fleming, with plots/breakdown art by Keith Giffen and full pencil
art by artist Curt Swan.

The Modern Age Aquaman is born as ORIN to Queen Atlanna and the
mysterious wizard Atlan in the Atlantean city of Poseidonis. As a baby,
he was abandoned on Mercy Reef (which is above sea level at low tide,
causing exposure to air which would be fatal to Atlanteans) because of
his blond hair, which was seen by the superstitious Atlanteans as a sign
of a curse they called "the Mark of Kordax." The only individual who
spoke up on Orin's behalf was Vulko, a scientist who had no patience for
myth or superstition. While his pleas fell on deaf ears, Vulko would
later become a close friend and advisor to the young Orin.

As a feral child who raised himself in the wilds of the ocean with only
sea creatures to keep him company, Orin was found and taken in by a
lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry who named Orin "Arthur Curry" after
himself. One day, Orin returns home and finds that his adoptive father
has disappeared, so he sets off on his own. In his early teens, Orin
ventures to the far north, where he meets and falls in love with an
Inupiat girl named Kako. He also first earned the hatred of Orm, the
future Ocean Master who was later revealed to be Arthur's half-brother
by Atlan and an Inupiat woman. Orin is driven away before he could
learn that Kako had become pregnant with his son, Koryak.

Orin then returned to the seas mostly staying out of humanity's sight,
until he discovers Poseidonis. He was captured by the city's
then-dictatorial government and placed in a prison camp, where he met
Vulko, also a prisoner of the state, who taught Orin the language and
ways of the Atlanteans. While Orin was there, he realized that his
mother was also being held captive, but after her death he broke out and
fled. Eventually, he made his way to the surface world, where under the
name of "Aquaman" he became one of several superheroes emerging into the
public view at the time. Upon his return to Poseidonis, he was made the
king, and sometime later he met and married Mera. The Modern Age
Aquaman's history is nearly identical to that of the Silver Age Aquaman
from this point on.

As detailed in the five-issue Aquaman limited series (June â€“ Oct.
1989) (by the same creative team of the 1989 special of Robert Loren
Fleming, Keith Giffen, and Curt Swan), which continued a few of the
themes from the Legend of Aquaman Special, Mera is eventually driven
insane by grief over the death of Arthur, Jr., and is committed to an
asylum in Poseidonis. Shortly afterwards, an alien force conquers
Atlantis. Arthur is forced to save the city but is hampered by an
escaped Mera, who personally blames Arthur for the death of their son.
In a fit of rage, Mera leaves Aquaman's dimension.

The publication of writer Peter David's The Atlantis Chronicles #1-7
(March â€“ Sept. 1990), which tells the story of Atlantis from
antediluvian times to Aquaman's birth, successfully revived interest in
the character introduced the ancient Atlantean characters Orin (after
whom Aquaman was named) and Atlan (who was revealed to be Aquaman's
father).

Another Aquaman ongoing series with creative team Shaun McLaughlin and
Ken Hooper (#1-13) thereafter ran from December 1991 to December 1992,
which portrayed Aquaman reluctantly deciding to remain in Poseidonis as
its protector once again. For a time, he serves as Atlantis'
representative to the United Nations but always finds himself thrust
back into the superhero role. Becoming more and more of a workaholic and
solitary figure, Aquaman eventually returns to the oceans. He soon
becomes tangles up in another attempt by Black Manta to destroy Atlantis
by dragging it into a war with a surface nation.

Peter David returned to the character in another limited series,
Aquaman: Time and Tide, a 1993-1994 four-issue series which further
explained Aquaman's origins, as he finally learns all about the history
of his people through the Atlantis Chronicles, which are presented as
historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries. Aquaman
learns that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy Ocean
Master share the same father, "an ancient Atlantean wizard" named Atlan.
This revelation sends Orin into a bout of rage and depression, setting
the stage for later confrontations between the two, as it is said in the
Chronicles that "two brothers will also battle for control of
Atlantis". This is in contrast to the Silver Age Aquaman, who had always
known that the Ocean Master was his half-brother Orm, although Orm's
amnesia prevented him from remembering that fact for some time. This
series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping
the character reach the height of his modern-era popularity.

New direction

[The 1990s version of Aquaman, from Aquaman vol. 5, #17 (Feb. 1996).
Art by Jim Calafiore.] Aquaman starred in his own series again with the
publication of the fifth Aquaman #1 (Aug. 1994), initially scripted by
Peter David, following up on his 1993 Time and Tide miniseries. This
series was the longest-running for the character, lasting until its 75th
issue. David left the series after issue #46 (July 1998) after working
on it for nearly four years.

David began by giving Aquaman an entirely new look, forsaking his former
clean-cut appearance. Following his discoveries reading the Atlantis
Chronicles during Time and Tide, Aquaman withdraws from the world for
a time. Garth finds him weeks later, with his hair and beard grown long,
brooding in his cave. Aquaman loses his left hand when the madman
Charybdis steals his ability to communicate with sea life and sticks
Arthur's hand into a piranha-infested pool. This causes Aquaman to
become somewhat unhinged, and he begins having prophetic dreams, and
then, in need of a "symbol", attaches a harpoon spearhead to his left
arm in place of his missing hand. His classic orange shirt is shredded
in a battle with Lobo, and rather than replace it, he goes shirtless
for a while before donning a gladiatorial manica. After the
destruction of the harpoon, Aquaman has it replaced with a
cybernetic prosthetic from S.T.A.R. Labs. This new harpoon has a
retractable reel that he can fully control.

A major storyline, culminating in #25, concerns the Five Lost Cities of
Atlantis. Facing an unearthly invading species linked to the origin of
the Atlanteans, Aquaman has to search out and unite the lost cities.
This storyline establishes him as a Warrior King and a major political
power, ruling largely undisputed over all the Atlantean cities. The
remainder of Peter David's run focused on Orin coming to terms with his
genetic heritage and his role as a king. During this time he discovers
the remnants of a sentient alien ship beneath Poseidonis, and is able to
take control of it, returning Poseidonis to the surface and bringing
Atlantis into greater contact with the outside world. The cultural
changes this brings about, including increased tourism, as well as his
conflicting duties as superhero and king, bring him into increasing
tension with the political powers in his city.

After a brief stint by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, David was replaced
as writer by Erik Larsen with issue #50 (Dec. 1998) and again by Dan
Jurgens in issue #63 (Jan. 2000). The series ended with #75 (Jan. 2001).
During this time his wife Mera returns, now sane again, from the
otherworldly dimension where she had been trapped, and Aquaman narrowly
averts a coup d'Ã©tat orchestrated by his son Koryak and his advisor
Vulko. His second harpoon is also destroyed, this time in a battle with
Noble, king of the Lurkers; he replaces it with a golden prosthetic hand
developed by Atlantean scientists which can change shape at his command,
thus retaining the powers of the harpoon but being more all-purpose.
After a brief war with an island nation, Aquaman expands Atlantis'
surface influence by annexing the country to Atlantis.

Hiatus between series

Aquaman had no regular series of his own from 2001â€“2003, but his plot
went through several developments via his cameo appearances in several
other titles.

Aquaman had rejoined the JLA when it reforms and remains an active,
if sometimes reluctant member of that team until the "Our Worlds at War"
storyline in 2001 (shortly after the cancellation of Aquaman vol. 5),
during which Aquaman and the city of Poseidonis disappear and are
presumed to be destroyed during a confrontation between Aquaman and an
Imperiex probe. In its place is a huge rift in the water of the ocean,
with a vast spectral statue of Aquaman standing over it that the JLA
install as a holographic beacon to both warn ships away from the trench
and provide a signal for the Atlanteans to use if they are ever able to
find their way back.

The Justice League eventually find that the city was still there, just
magically shielded, but in ruins and apparently uninhabited. The
Atlanteans are trapped in the ancient past, where Tempest had sent them
as a last measure when it appeared that the city would be destroyed by
the probe. There, however, they are enslaved by their own Atlantean
ancestors, led by a powerful sorceress named Gamemnae, and Aquaman
himself is transformed into living water and imprisoned in an ornamental
pool. Over time, this civilization had collapsed until only Gamemnae
herself, now immensely powerful, inhabited the ruins.

After a few months of their time â€” but fully fifteen years for the
Atlanteans â€” the JLA free Aquaman in "The Obsidian Age" storyline in
JLA. Although the original League are killed by Gamemnae, their
souls are contained by the magician Manitou Raven to use in a spell to
contain Gamemnae in Atlantis until the present day, when he is able to
resurrect them. With the aid of Nightwing, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, Zatanna
and Manitou Raven. The first four are members of the Reserve JLA that
had been put together by a program created by Batman that automatically
activates after the League vanishes into the past with the aid of the
Manitou Raven of their time. Aquaman is freed from his prison in the
pool, and Zatanna enhances his powers so that he can now control the
entire ocean as a water wraith. With this power, Aquaman is able to
sever Gamemnae's connection to the city by sinking it under the sea
again. While he fights Gamemnae, the League members return the modern
Atlanteans to the present, where they can begin rebuilding the city,
which in the present too is once again at the bottom of the sea.

Back to basics

[2003 series' initial look by Yvel Guichet.] A sixth Aquaman series
began shortly afterwards, initially written by Rick Veitch who sought to
take Aquaman in a more mystical direction. Subsequent writers who
contributed to the series include John Ostrander, Will Pfeifer, Tad
Williams, and John Arcudi. This series ran 57 issues starting in
December 2002 (cover dated February 2003); starting with #39 (April
2006), following the events of the "Infinite Crisis" storyline, it was
renamed Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis._

Aquaman is blamed by his people for the initial decision to take them
back in time, and sentenced to death. He escapes, and meets the Lady of
the Lake, who gives him a new prosthetic hand composed of mystical water
with unusual properties. From there he gradually returns to his more
traditional lookâ€”orange shirt, short hair, and beardlessâ€”but does not
return to his city for several years.

Later, Aquaman goes to San Diego after a massive earthquake plunges half
the city into the Pacific Ocean. He discovers that many people have
survived the catastrophe, somehow gaining the ability to breathe
underwater, and he begins helping them to rebuild the submerged portion
of the city they now called "Sub Diego". During this time, Aquaman picks
up a new sidekick named Lorena, who eventually becomes the new Aquagirl:
she is the only one of the Sub Diegans who retains the ability to
breathe air as well as water.

Aquaman's exile is revealed to have been orchestrated by a sorcerer
class who have come to power using knowledge gained in the Obsidian Age.
After they are overthrown the city makes overtures for him to return as
their king. He declines, but for a time, it appears that Aquaman might
reconcile with Mera, as he attempts to take her to the surface in order
to save her from the Atlantean mages who have transformed her into an
air-breather.

As a metatextual nod to the positive reception of the new series, a
scene in Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers miniseries shows Aquaman
winning the "Best Comeback" award at a popular superhero convention.

Shortly thereafter, during the "Infinite Crisis" storyline, Atlantis is
destroyed by the Spectre, and many of its citizens are killed, including
Aquaman's son Koryak and his oldest friend and mentor Vulko. Aquaman
leads the survivors to Sub Diego in the hope that the two displaced
peoples can help each other. When Black Manta attacks the sunken city,
Aquaman defeats him and leaves him for dead, surrounded by carnivorous
fish. It is later revealed that Manta survived.

The missing year through "Final Crisis"

Following the "One Year Later" storyline (starting with Aquaman vol.
6, #40, May 2006), the series was renamed Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis
and taken in an entirely different direction by writer Kurt Busiek.
Aquaman is missing and presumed dead. A youth by the name of "Arthur
Joseph Curry" is summoned by the mysterious Dweller in the Depths to
take up the mantle of Aquaman, but it gradually emerges that the Dweller
himself is Aquaman, having lost much of his memory and been strangely
mutated, while gaining magical powers. (See the Arthur Joseph Curry
section, below.)

These changes were explained later during the "missing year" depicted in
the weekly series 52. Aquaman makes a brief appearance at the memorial
for Superboy. Sometime later Ralph Dibny, seemingly accompanied by Dr.
Fate's helmet, meets a bearded, long-haired, and amnesic Orin in the
ruins of Atlantis. The helmet portends that "if he lives... if he
lives... it is as a victim of the magicks of legend and the power of the
sea."

Orin makes a deal with the gods of the sea in a desperate bid to gain
the power to save the lives of several Sub Diego inhabitants who had
lost the ability to live in water. Using the bones of his severed left
hand in a magical ritual, the sea gods give Orin the power to raise Sub
Diego onto dry land. However, as a side effect of this, Orin mutates
into the "Dweller of the Depths", and loses his memories. The fate
he foresaw for Arthur Joseph Curry was a confused memory of his own
past.

In the midst of trying to help his successor, Orin is murdered by Black
Manta. Upon the receipt of Orin's body, members of the Justice
League of America, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and the
Flash, examine the body in Atlantis and wish the best for Mera and the
new Aquaman.

Orin seemingly reappears in Atlantis during the 2008 "Final Crisis"
storyline to fend off the forces of Darkseid, but this Aquaman is
revealed to be from another Earth in the multiverse. The
appearance of this Aquaman is later perceived by Hal Jordan and Barry
Allen as an unsubstantiated rumor, since this person was never seen nor
heard from again. Sometime between his death and the beginning of
the 2008-09 "Blackest Night" storyline, Orin's body is moved and buried
on land at Mercy Reef alongside Tom Curry in accordance with his final
wishes.

Blackest Night

In Blackest Night #1, Garth returns to Atlantis and tells Orin's wife
Mera that he is angry at the notion of Aquaman's body being buried on
land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that it is
indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen
entering Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises,
along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black
Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering
her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black
Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax
of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White
Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern
Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is
restored as well.

Brightest Day

Aquaman and Mera spend the night together in the lighthouse of Amnesty
Bay, but in the morning Mera finds Arthur on the dock looking at the sea
and wondering why he was resurrected. Later, they intercept a pirate
vessel but Aquaman finds that he can only call on dead sea life to help
him.

While cleaning up an oil spill, Aquaman and Mera are attacked by
soldiers from Mera's homeworld, led by Siren. Mera reveals that she was
sent to kill him. She also hints that, despite the long-lasting
exile of her people, Xebel's soldiers had been enemies of Black Manta
himself from a distant time, even preceding the first public appearance
of Aquaman, and states that, despite Mera's original mission being a
solo one, Siren is now backed by the entire Death Squad, elite Xebel
soldiers, at the orders of the acting princess. She later reveals that
Siren is her younger sister.

Aquaman is told by the White Lantern Entity to find Jackson Hyde before
a second, unidentified group does. Mera states that she knows who he
is, and after she tells him, Aquaman leaves, and rescues Jackson
from an Xebel attack. It is revealed that Aquaman's Silver Age origin
has been re-established and he is once again the half-human son of Tom
Curry and an Atlantean queen. The Entity subsequently reduces
Aquaman to what appears to be white water. Aquaman is revealed to be
one of the Elementals, and was transformed by the Entity to become the
element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar,
which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing.
After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing returns Aquaman to
normal. Afterward, Aquaman is reunited with Mera, at which point he
discovers that the Xebels' weapons were made of Atlantean
technology.

The New 52, "Convergence" and beyond

[Writer Geoff Johns holding up an Aquaman Bobblehead signed by him and
artist Jim Lee at Midtown Comics in Manhattan.] As part of The New 52,
's 2011 relaunch of their entire superhero line, Geoff Johns, Ivan
Reis and Joe Prado served as the initial creative team of the company's
new Aquaman series, the first issue of which was released September
28, 2011. The three creators remained on the title for the first 16
issues. That subsequently lead into the first New 52 continual,
Aquaman related 'Mega-Event' (cross-over) in years "Throne of Atlantis".

The relaunched series cements Aquaman's status as the half-human son of
Tom Curry and Atlanna, and sees him return to Amnesty Bay with Mera.
Greatly distressed by the harsh treatment given to the oceans during his
time as ruler of Atlantis, Aquaman decides to abdicate the Atlantean
throne and return to full-time heroics. However, he now struggles with
his lack of reputation with the greater public, which views him as a
lesser metahuman with less impressive powers than those of his
peers. He is also once again a founding member of the Justice League
and is a main member of the team. It is revealed in Aquaman #7
that early in his career, Aquaman had teamed with a mysterious
loose-knit group of characters simply known as The Others, consisting of
Aquaman himself, the South American jungle girl Ya'Wara and her panther,
the Russian known as Vostok-X, an ex-army veteran called
Prisoner-of-War, The Operative, and the Iranian called Kahina the Seer.
All of The Others have in their possession an enchanted relic from
Atlantis. From 2014 to 2015, an independent Aquaman and the Others
series was launched.

Following the 2015 "Convergence" storyline, Aquaman gets a new look in
issue #41. He has been deposed from his throne by Mera, now Queen of
Atlantis, who is now hunting Aquaman as a fugitive, along the way Arthur
acquires some new powers and new equipment giving him access to powerful
mystical capabilities.


Arthur Joseph Curry

ARTHUR JOSEPH CURRY is the second  superhero to be known as
AQUAMAN. Created by Kurt Busiek and Jackson Guice, he first appeared in
Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #40 (May 2006). As part of ' One
Year Later event, Aquaman's series was renamed Aquaman: Sword of
Atlantis with issue #40 (May 2006). The new developments include a new
lead character, a new supporting cast, and the inclusion of sword and
sorcery-type fantasy elements in the series. The character was
short-lived, and was not seen much leading up to the revival of Aquaman
in the 2010 Blackest Night miniseries, and is not featured in 
continuity at all following its 2011 reboot, The New 52.

Arthur's story resembles versions of the original Aquaman's. While
awaiting transport to Miami, Florida, a young man named Arthur Joseph
Curry is washed out to sea when a storm ruptures the tank he is in. This
Arthur Curry, much like the Golden Age Aquaman, is the son of
oceanobiologist Dr. Phillip Curry. Arthur's mother, Elaine, died in
childbirth and Dr. Curry was forced to use a mutagenic serum on his son
when he was born three months premature. Arthur has lived his whole life
in the main tank of his father's research facility at Avalon Cay, his
only window to the outside world being television.

Shortly after his arrival in the sea, Arthur is mentally contacted by
the mysterious "Dweller of the Depths," a deformed humanoid with
tentacles instead of hair and a left hand made of water. The Dweller
urges him to help King Shark, who still bears scars from a previous
battle with Aquaman during the recent Crisis. The Dweller, confusing
Arthur for Aquaman and calling him his "charge," tells Arthur and King
Shark of a prophecy regarding Arthur's future, a prophecy which seems to
be a distorted version of the original Aquaman's history. The Dweller
reveals that the original Aquaman was _"transformed into one akin to a
great and terrible enemy of your people and became the vessel of power
strange, ancient and terrible."_

Arthur's first trip causes him to meet many of Aquaman's supporting
characters including Mera, the Sea Devils, Vulko, and eventually Ocean
Master. During this adventure, the Dweller progressively realizes that
he himself is the original Aquaman, despite having no memory of his
former life.

Later, Arthur finds a humanoid squid named Topo, a naive youth attracted
by superheroics and seeking to become a sidekick, and Tempest, now
amnesiac, unable to breathe water, and implanted with a post-hypnotic
suggestion warning of an upcoming battle. The battle soon occurs, and
the Dweller/Orin is apparently killed. The Justice League is called in
to evaluate Orin's situation, but are unable to determine if he is truly
dead, or if he can somehow resurrect himself due to his new magical
nature.

In Sword of Atlantis #57, the series' final issue, Aquaman is visited
by the Lady of the Lake, who explains his origins. The original Aquaman
had given a sample of his water hand to Dr. Curry in order to resurrect
Curry's dead son, Arthur, whom he had named after Orin. When Orin
attempted to resurrect Sub Diego, a part of his soul attached itself to
the dead body of Arthur Joseph Curry, while Orin mutated into the
Dweller. Blaming himself for Orin's death, Aquaman vows to never be
called "Arthur" again, refraining from using the "stolen" name, asking
only to be called Joseph in the future.

Joseph is considered as a candidate for the new Outsiders by Batman.
After seeing him in action with Metamorpho, however, Batman decides
against his induction.

In their quest to rid the Earth of all forms of kryptonite, Superman and
Batman journey deep below the sea and find a large amount of it. The two
of them are met with hostility by Aquaman and King Shark. A brief fight
ensues, but eventually Joseph allows them to take the kryptonite. Before
doing so, he points out that not everyone may want Superman to find all
of Earth's kryptonite, and that he would have to be at least part human
to know that.

Joseph Curry would continue to be the stand-in king of Atlantis until
after the "Final Crisis" storyline. It was revealed that Joseph had
stepped down from his position due to being unable to deal with the
pressure of carrying on Orin's legacy. Tempest later finds Joseph's
trident and costume draped over Orin's throne, confirming that he had
abandoned his duties.


Powers and abilities

Aquaman's most widely recognized power is the telepathic ability to
communicate with marine life, which he can summon from great distances.
Although this power is most often and most easily used on marine life,
Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that
lives upon the sea (e.g., sea eagles), or even any being evolved from
marine life (e.g., humans and some aliens). Before the New 52 Aquaman
had access to a morphogenic field phenomenon called The Clear, an
existential effigy that connects all oceanic and sea related life
together as a whole, allowing him to empathize and share in the
experiences of all aquatic based lifeforms. Per the 2011  continuity
reboot, Aquaman's telepathy has been greatly downplayed: acknowledging
that most marine life doesn't possess enough intelligence to carry a
meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add
compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to
do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum. Recently he
has shown to have been blessed by the Sea God Poseidon possibly
regaining a stronger but latent connection to The Clear when he was
shown to bend the poisonous bile emitting from an old world structure
that had intruded from the sea poisoning it with dark magic, developing
some liquid manipulatory abilities. This blessing also gave him a
protective charm against the foul magics of the Thule dimension it had
originated from.

Aquaman has a number of superhuman powers, most of which derive from the
fact that he is adapted to live in the depths of the ocean. He has the
ability to breathe underwater. He possesses superhuman durability high
enough to remain unaffected by the immense pressure and the cold
temperature of the ocean depths, this also makes him tough enough to be
invulnerable to machine gun fire. He also possesses superhuman
strength. He can swim at very high speeds, capable of reaching
speeds of 3,000Â meters per second (10,800Â km [roughly 6,700 miles]
per hour) and can swim up Niagara Falls. He can see in near total
darkness and has enhanced hearing granting limited sonar. Although
he can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects,
Aquaman grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods. However,
when Batman invented Aquaman's water suit he was able to walk on land
for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a
"dehumidifier". This weakness was later removed from continuity in
2011, establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his
Atlantean heritage, but he still runs the risk of dying by
dehydration within incredibly hostile environments. Recently AC had
been bestowed an ability he never showcased before gifted unto him by an
old Sea Monarch, so far one of said proclivities granted to him was the
ability of unaided flight under his own power.

Before the New 52 The Trident (granted by Poseidon to the rightful ruler
and protector of the seas) was indestructible and a very powerful melee
weapon (able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes), which
Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from that the Trident had
also the power to manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and
act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others (like most notably
Tempest). In the New 52 (current continuity) The Trident is now part of
a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by
the first king of Atlantis who calls himself 'The Dead King'. Thought to
be the most powerful weapon of the set (although the discovery of a
seventh hidden item might put this claim to test), the trident is
completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of
opponents such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only
leaguer to puncture and make him bleed out. He was also able to break
the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at
the time. On one instance the trident was shown glowing with magical
power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden
seventh one. Apart from all its power the Trident acts as a symbol of
Aquaman's authority and his trademark weapon, which he wields with
unmatched skill. For a time Aquaman withheld the Trident of said
aforementioned god of oceans in his battles against the thule which
enabled him power over the storm calling down thunder & lighting,
projecting and controlling ice, causing the earth to move, rise and
tremble at his command as well as teleport global to interplanetary
distances using water as a medium. it could also transform into a
gladius & back at will 

After the loss of his left hand, Aquaman initially replaced it with a
cybernetic retractable hook, then a cybernetic hand. The mechanical hand
was replaced by a magical hand made out of water given to him by the
Lady of the Lake, which grants Aquaman numerous abilities, including but
not limited to: the ability to dehydrate anyone he touches and killing
them instantly, the ability to shoot jets of water from his hand,
scalding or freezing, healing abilities, the ability to create portals
into mystical dimensions acting as spontaneous transport, controlling
most any body of water he sets his focuses on and the ability to
communicate with the Lady of the Lake through the waterbearer hand.
His biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in
Blackest Night #8.

On rare occasions Arthur had been transformed into a living body of
sentient water sometimes an extension of the seas themselves, this has
been done on three occasion but he has shown his ability to cognitize
himself quite masterfully in doing so. Having once embodied the entire
ocean to re-sink Atlantis during the Obsidian Age, Been taken over by
the ravenous Thirst entity becoming The Waterbearer itself and finally
after his resurrection where he was de-materialized the White Light of
Life only to be reborn as a water elemental to aid against the rot
imprinted Swamp Thing in Brightest Day #24


Other versions

-   In the 1960s, following the establishment of ' multiverse
    system, the Golden Age version of Aquaman became known as the
    Aquaman of Earth-Two, while the Silver Age version of Aquaman became
    the Aquaman of Earth-One. Although the two versions never met, the
    Earth-Two Aquaman did appear post-Golden Age in All-Star Squadron
    #59-60 (July â€“ August 1986), just before the character was
    retroactively eliminated from existence via the 1985 "Crisis on
    Infinite Earths" storyline.
-   The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew presented
    the parallel Earth of "Earth-C-Minus," a world populated by funny
    animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream  Universe.
    Earth-C-Minus featured Aquaduck, a duck version of Aquaman with
    similar powers.
-   Aquaman watches over the seas and his kingdom in the Supergirl:
    Wings Elseworlds story.

    Amerika, Barracuda is Aquaman's CSA counterpart. He was last seen
    leading the armies of Atlantis against the surface world in Florida.
-   In the Countdown tie-in The Search for Ray Palmer:
    Superwoman/Batwoman, a female version of Aquaman is shown to reside
    on Earth-11. This version is called "Anne", is physically similar to
    Joseph Curry, and commands the armies of Atlantis. The Aquawoman of
    the slightly revised Earth-11 appears in The Multiversity
    #1 (2014) as one of the assembled heroes of the Multiverse who have
    come together to save it from destruction.
-   In the 2003-04 intercompany crossover JLA/Avengers, Aquaman teams

    respective Earth's as a result of the actions of the Grandmaster. He
    displays his immense psychic control over sea life when he
    single-handedly shuts down the minds of Atlantean soldiers under the
    control of Attuma, although his abilities only partially affect
    Namor due to Namor's half-human physiology.
-   In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "Flashpoint" storyline,
    Aquaman is brought back to Atlantis when he was a teenager, due to
    the death of his father. As a result, the young Arthur never learned
    compassion and kindness from his father, who was killed by the
    Atlantean agents sent to recover him. In the present day,
    Aquaman and all of Atlantis wage war against Wonder Woman and the
    Amazons, which began when Diana's mother, Hippolyta, was killed
    on Aquaman and Diana's wedding day, and in an act of retribution,
    Wonder Woman later killed Mera who had apparently married
    Aquaman. The death of Hippolyta was however revealed to be a
    casualty of war as the real target was Wonder Woman. Aquaman causes
    Western Europe to sink into the, sea killing over 60 million people,
    and intends to sink England as well. In the present, Aquaman
    reassigns Siren and Ocean Master to assassinate Terra in
    New Themyscira. The mission failed, with Siren being killed by
    Diana's aunt, Penthesleia. The Amazonian Furies then attack the
    reinforcements led by Aquaman, who is confronted in battle by their
    leader, Wonder Woman. During their struggle, Wonder Woman tells
    him that they have both been deceive by Ocean Master and
    Penthesileia, who are responsible for the war between the Atlanteans
    and the Amazons. This Aquaman returns in Convergence: Justice
    League #1.
-   During the 2013 "Trinity War" storyline, Aquaman's Crime Syndicate
    counterpart is revealed to be Sea King. He apparently fails to

    King resembles that of 1990s Aquaman. but is awakened in
    "Forever Evil: Blight" after being possessed by Deadman.
-   In the prequel comic to the game "Injustice: Gods Among Us" Aquaman
    appears to attack Japanese fisherman who kill a whale. He is

    between the League and the Atlanteans. Superman, having undergone
    the death of his wife and unborn child and the destruction of
    Metropolis, threatens Aquaman to stop his efforts. While warned over
    a communication link with Batman not to test him, Aquaman does by
    summoning a kraken. In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and
    Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and
    carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants in harm to
    bully Aquaman. He relents and as a result of this largely abstains
    from the conflict between the Regime (led by Superman) and the
    Insurgency (led by Batman). In Year Four he gets involved, however,
    when Batman informs him that the Greek gods have attempted to force
    their own rule over the world, so Aquaman and Mera take on Poseidon.
    He wins the conflict as his wife stalls a massive tidal wave from
    crashing on Themiscyra.

Reception and legacy

Aquaman was listed as the 147th greatest comic book character of all
time by Wizard magazine. IGN also ranked Aquaman as the 53rd
greatest comic book hero of all time, opining that "even though he'll
forever be the butt of jokes thanks to his fishy powers, comic readers
have come to love Aquaman as a noble (and very powerful) figure who is
forever torn between the worlds of land and sea." In a 2011 reader
poll, Parade magazine ranked Aquaman among the Top 10 Superheroes of
All Time.

By 2008, cultural critic Glen Weldon noted that Aquaman had become
ridiculed by a popular mindset that cast him as an ineffectual hero.
This was due to the perception that his heroic abilities were too
narrow. Weldon wrote that critics and popculture comedians who chose to
focus on this had overplayed the joke, making it "officially the
hoariest, hackiest arrow in the quiver of pop-culture
commentary."
