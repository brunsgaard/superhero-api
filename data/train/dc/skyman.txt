SKYMAN is the name of two fictional superheroes from the 
Universe.


Sylvester Pemberton

' Skyman was the original Star-Spangled Kid, SYLVESTER
PEMBERTON, a Golden Age character. He became the Star-Spangled Kid in
order to battle Nazism during World War II. He was unique in that he was
a kid superhero who had an adult sidekick, Stripesy a.k.a. Pat Dugan.
Both he and Dugan were superb acrobats along with having sufficient
training in hand-to-hand combat.

Pemberton then changed his name to SKYMAN and founded Infinity Inc.
Skyman led the team until his accidental death at the hands of Mister
Bones.


Jacob Colby

as one of the first official subjects for Lex Luthor's "Everyman
Project". Luthor's project grants super-powers to Colby, who is given
the codename SKYMAN after Luthor buys the rights to Infinity Inc. from
the Pemberton Estate. This Skyman had the power to control the air, and
the power of flight. Colby later becomes romantically involved with his
teammate Starlight.

It is later revealed that Colby had been killed by his teammate,
Everyman, who consumed Colby's body and gained the ability to assume his
form, posing as Colby since his murder (fooling even Starlight with his
deception).
