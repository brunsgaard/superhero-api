Fictional character biography

One thousand years ago, Sir Lancelot succeeded in the quest to find the
Holy Grail and ascended, as does Sir Galahad. After an initial failure
Sir Percival is able to discover the Grail, Merlin then appears before
Percival, asks him to guard the mystic prison in Hell that he had
created for all the evil creatures in England at King Arthur's request.
Merlin sent Percival into the Region Beyond, where his purity manifested
as the Golden Knight. Etrigan the Demon fights the Golden Knight in
order to gain passage into the prison. The Golden Knight eternally
guards a gateway which leads from England to Hell's REGION BEYOND
(possibly the Infernal Province known as the Labyrinth). Etrigan leaves
his brother Lord Scapegoat a resident of the prison, stranded in the
Region Beyond, and escapes with a mystical scroll from the
Thing-that-cannot-die.
