BAT-COW is a fictional cow appearing in American comic books published
by  and other associated media.


History

Bat-Cow was found by Robin during an investigation on a slaughterhouse,
which the cow was sent to. Robin wanted to keep the cow, and named it
Bat-Cow. Batman decided they would keep the cow, but during a later
investigation discovered it had mind controlling radiation inside of it,
leading him to attempt to get rid of the cow. Robin, however would not
allow him to hurt the cow.

After the events of Robin's death, Bat-Cow and Robin's dog felt a great
loss in morale. Alfred Pennyworth and Nightwing had to take care of the
cow. Later, after Nightwing's disappearance, Alfred was the only
caretaker of Bat-Cow.

Bat-Cow, complete with cape, spent time on a Wayne-owned dairy farm. It
was there the cow encountered the cosmic-powered "Forever People." One
of them seemed to gain guidance from Bat-Cow's actions, namely when
Bat-Cow gave one of the Forever People a scarecrow's hat.

Bat-Cow forms a friendship with Titus, a dog and household cat.
