MONSTERGIRL (AKA RITA LOPEZ) is a  superheroine. She was
created by Dan Raspler and Dev Madan. She is a former member of the
Young Heroes.


Fictional character biography

Monstergirl was raised by Hector and Elena Lopez, whom she believed to
be her parents. She was really an alien, of the race Farfarmniflatch,
but she did not learn this until she was an adult. She joined the Young
Heroes with her childhood friend/ sometime lover/ lackey, Thunderhead.
Monstergirl has occasionally appeared in other  titles
including Wonder Woman and Young Justice.

Monstergirl was somewhat unusual for a superhero in that she was very
Machiavellian. Over the course of Young Heroes in Love she attempted
to seduce a number of her teammates and also exhibited a rather cold,
selfish personality.

For a while, she was mainly romantically involved with her teammate
Hardrive. After he left, she assumed more of a leadership role.

She has faced down the Scarecrow, a skyscraper sized Amazonian monster
and helped protect an elementary school from a protection racket.

Later in the series, she was confronted by her uncle, who forced her
into a life and death fight all aliens of her age went through. She
subdued the entity with help from friends and allies. Her uncle went
away impressed, because she had used more than just skills to fight him,
she had used her friends, battlefield obstacles and resources. She then
goes to work for Hard Drive, now the governor of Connecticut.


Powers and abilities

Monstergirl has the ability to shapeshift into bizarre animals, such as
scaly dragon-like wolves, or bat-like birds (often covered with bony
spikes). She can also assume human forms (such as when she shapeshifted
into Bonfire.) She has expressed confusion over the full extent of her
own powers.
