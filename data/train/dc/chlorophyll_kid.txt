CHLOROPHYLL KID is a fictional character, a superhero in the 
Universe.


Fictional character biography

Chlorophyll Kid was born Ral Benem on the planet Mardru. As a young man,
he accidentally fell into a tank of hydroponic serum which gave him the
power to stimulate plant growth. He can grow seeds into full grown
plants in a second. Ral can also direct the growth of vines so that they
wrap around a person, trapping them. He has also claimed that he can
talk to plants. Ral possesses an extensive knowledge regarding all types
of plants and seeds. He carries a variety of seeds in his costume for
various uses. He tries out for the Legion of Super-Heroes, but is
rejected when the Legion decides that his power would not be useful on
missions. Along with several other failed applicants, he helps form the
Legion of Substitute Heroes.

Chlorophyll Kid appears in the one-shot Legion of Substitute Heroes
comic book, where he is portrayed in a more comical fashion. In this
story, Chlorophyll Kid is shown to have put on much weight.

In the Action Comics storyline Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes,
Chlorophyll Kid and his fellow substitutes are sent to distract the
renegade Justice League. Chlorophyll Kid is shown to have much greater
control over his powers, and he battles Storm Boy successfully. His
hands now take on a plant-like appearance when he uses his powers.


In other media

Chlorophyll Kid appears in two episodes of the Legion of Super Heroes
animated series, "Lightning Storm" and "The Substitute". His character
was voiced by Alexander Polinsky.
