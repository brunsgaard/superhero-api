Fictional character biography

First appearance

Little Barda first appears in a scrapbook created by fellow Titan Raven,
which had pictures of the 20 members who joined and left the Teen Titans
during the lost year gap. Little Barda's picture shows her demonstrating
her strength by picking up a car with one hand.

52

Barda appears alongside a small group of Titans in 52 #21 when they
became introduced with a new version of an old team, Infinity, Inc. One
Infinitor confuses her with Big Barda, until Little Barda corrects her
and states, "But maybe one day I'll be the big" (she is shown blowing a
bubble gum bubble as she says this line). She seems to be on good terms
with fellow Titan Power Boy, as both of them came from Apokolips. At the
end of the issue, she and Power Boy resign from the Titans team and
depart for places unknown.

Titans East

Later, Little Barda joins a newly formed Titans East. However, their
first training session turns into a massacre when the group is attacked
by a mysterious foe who kills Power Boy. Little Barda and the rest of
her Titans East teammates are left in critical condition. She
eventually recovers.


Other versions

-   A toddler version of Little Barda appears in several issues of Tiny
    Titans.
