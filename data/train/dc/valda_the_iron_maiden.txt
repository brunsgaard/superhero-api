Fictional character biography

Valda the Iron Maiden was a female knight and one of the Twelve Peers of
Carolus Magnus' court. She was born in Aix-la-Chapelle, Frankland in the
8th century A.D., the daughter of Bradamante and (reputedly) Carolus
Magnus.

After her mother's death in the ambush at Roncesvalles, Valda was
brought up by Carolus Magnus, his court sorcerer Malagigi and Bishop
Turpin. She was tutored as a swordswoman by the ghost of Amadis of Gaul,
who she had summoned with a spell that she had overheard Malagigi using.
Initially refused knighthood by the king, she posed as the "Knight All
in Scarlet" and defeated her uncle, the great knight Rinaldo, in a joust
to earn the honour.

She was 5' 6" tall, weighed 113 lbs, and had blue eyes and dark brown
hair.

She first met Arak, Son of Thunder while she was under the spell of the
sorcerer Baledor and later joined him in searching for Malagigi who had
been captured by the sorceress Angelica. Valda and Arak adventured
together and fell in love.

More recently, she was transported to the present day to become a member
of the extended Shadowpact in the Day of Vengeance special.
