accounts), it is known that her family was murdered and that she is
seeking to avenge this. She is secretly in love with Dharma, the team's
leader, as evidenced when she refused to escape after he decided to
imprison the entire team in their base.

Iron Butterfly is able to move and shape metal and metallic objects. She
can apparently feel the details of composition of the metal. When going
into battle she wears medieval style plate armor with huge angel wings.
