Fictional character biography

Miss X aided Tex Thompson and Bob Daley after the third member of their
team Gargantua T. Potts left to become a cook in the French Army. She
wore no costume, and her sole disguise consisted of a pair of dark
sunglasses. Tex was intrigued and obsessed with finding out who the
mysterious Miss X was. In the final panel of Action Comics #29, he
confided to his partner that he thought he had figured out who she was.

In Action Comics #33, Thompson was declared dead. This turned out to
be a ruse, and Thompson returned as Mister America. Miss X made her
final appearance in Action Comics #43 (Dec. 1941).
