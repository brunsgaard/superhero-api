EDDIE WHIT's parents were a circus strongman and acrobat, and after they
die, he becomes a juvenile delinquent. Eddie is sent to Lacklock Camp, a
reform school of sorts. After being released, he gains custody of his
younger brother Danny and takes a job at Zenith Caterer. The owner of
Zenith, Krasko, claims he has proof that Danny is involved in
gang-related crimes, and blackmails Eddie into committing burglaries
under the costumed guise of the Ant. The Teen Titans are sent in to
investigate, and when they learn the details of Eddie's situation they
are sympathetic. During a robbery Ant turns against Krasko and helps the
Teen Titans put him behind bars. As a reward for his cooperation, the
Titans promise Ant that he will not serve a prison sentence, but will
only have to spend some more time in Lacklock Camp.
