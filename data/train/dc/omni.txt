Fictional character biography

Cameron Begay was a young super-powered agent of the D.E.O., going under
the name of Cypher and wielding the ability to mimic other meta-human
super-powers. Eventually, he was adopted by the Weinberg family. When
the Weinberg parents died in a car crash, Cameron and his adopted
siblings (all super-powered) took on super-hero identities and embarked
on a quest to find Superman. Cameron became Omni. Eventually, it was
revealed that Omni was a member of the shapeshifting alien race known as
the "Es". Upon learning the truth, Omni refused to leave Earth with the
Es and currently hangs out with the rest of the Weinbergs.

The Relative Heroes were last seen assisting Young Justice and many
other young superheroes against the villain army of Agua Sin Gaaz in
Zandia. The purpose of this attack was to strike back for the murder of
the parents of Empress, a member of Young Justice. The entire invading
force soon fought and defeated the size-changing queen of Zandia.
