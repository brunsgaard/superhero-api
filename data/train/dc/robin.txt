ROBIN is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American
comic books published by . The character was originally created
by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior
counterpart to superhero Batman. The team of Batman and Robin is
commonly referred to as the Dynamic Duo or the Caped Crusaders. The
character's first incarnation, DICK GRAYSON, debuted in Detective
Comics #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a vehicle to attract young
readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception,
doubling the sales of the Batman related comic books. The early
adventures of Robin included Star Spangled Comics #65–130 (1947–1952),
which was the character's first solo feature. Robin made regular
appearances in Batman related comic books and other 
publications from 1940 through the early 1980s until the character set
aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing.

The character's second incarnation JASON TODD debuted in Batman #357
(1983). This Robin made regular appearances in Batman related comic
books until 1988, when the character was murdered by the Joker in the
storyline "A Death in the Family" (1989). Jason would later find himself
alive after a reality changing incident, eventually becoming the Red
Hood. The premiere Robin limited series was published in 1991 which
featured the character's third incarnation TIM DRAKE training to earn
the role of Batman's junior partner. Following two successful sequels,
the monthly Robin ongoing series began in 1993 and ended in early
2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in
his own right. In 2004 storylines, established  character
STEPHANIE BROWN became the fourth Robin for a short while before the
role reverted to Tim Drake. Batman's son DAMIAN WAYNE then succeeds
Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc "Battle for the Cowl", until his
death in 2013 story. Following the 2011 continuity reboot "The New 52",
Tim Drake is revised as having assumed the title Red Robin out of
deference to the deceased Jason Todd; Jason Todd, as he exists today,
operates as the Red Hood and has been slowly repairing his relationship
with Batman; Dick Grayson is Nightwing, and later fakes his death to
become an undercover operative; and Stephanie Brown is introduced anew
as Spoiler once again in the pages of Batman Eternal (2014).

Robins have also been featured throughout stories set in parallel
worlds, owing to 's longstanding "Multiverse" concept. For example, in
the original Earth-Two, Dick Grayson never adopted the name Nightwing,
and continues operating as Robin into adulthood. In The New 52's new
"Earth-2" continuity, Robin is Helena Wayne, daughter of Batman and
Catwoman, who was stranded in the Earth of the main continuity following
her father's death at the hands of an alien invasion. Operating
alongside Power Girl on Prime Earth, she takes the name Huntress.


Fictional character biography

About a year after Batman's debut, Batman creators Bob Kane and Bill
Finger introduced Robin the Boy Wonder in Detective Comics #38 (1940).
The name "Robin the Boy Wonder" and the medieval look of the original
costume were inspired by The Adventures of Robin Hood. Robinson noted
he "came up with Robin Hood because The Adventures of Robin Hood were
boyhood favorites of mine. I had been given a Robin Hood book
illustrated by N. C. Wyeth ... and that's what I quickly sketched out
when I suggested the name Robin Hood, which they seemed to like, and
then showed them the costume. And if you look at it, it's Wyeth's
costume, from my memory, because I didn't have the book to look at."
(Some later accounts of Robin's origin have stated that the name comes
from the American robin bird, not from Robin Hood, Frank Miller's
All Star Batman and Robin being a notable exception. Sometimes both
sources are credited, as in Len Wein's The Untold Legend of the
Batman.) Although Robin is best known as Batman's sidekick, the Robins
have also been members of the superhero group the Teen Titans - with the
original Robin, Dick Grayson, as a founding member and the group's
leader and with Tim Drake as the team leader .

In Batman stories the character of Robin was intended to be the Batman's
Watson: Bill Finger, writer for many early Batman adventures, wrote:

  "Robin was an outgrowth of a conversation I had with Bob. As I said,
  Batman was a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes.
  Holmes had his Watson. The thing that bothered me was that Batman
  didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always
  having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a
  Watson to talk to. That's how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and
  said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I
  thought it was a great idea."

The following fictional characters have donned the Robin costume at
various times in the main continuity:

Dick Grayson

Dick Grayson was an 8-year-old acrobat, the youngest of a family act
called the "Flying Graysons". A gangster named Boss Zucco (loosely based
on actor Edward G. Robinson's Little Caesar character) who had been
extorting money from the circus killed Grayson's parents, John and Mary,
by sabotaging their trapeze equipment as a warning against defiance.
Batman investigated the crime and, as his alter ego billionaire Bruce
Wayne, had Dick put under his custody as a legal ward. Together they
investigated Zucco and collected the evidence needed to bring him to
justice. From his debut appearance in 1940 through 1969, Robin was known
as the Boy Wonder. Batman creates a costume for Dick, consisting of a
red tunic, yellow cape, green gloves, green boots, green spandex briefs,
and a utility belt. As he grew up, graduated from high school and
enrolled in Hudson University, Robin continued his career as the Teen
Wonder, from 1970 into the early 1980s. The character was re-discovered
by a new generation of fans during the 1980s because of the success of
The New Teen Titans, in which he left Batman's shadow entirely to
assume the identity of Nightwing. He aids Batman throughout the later
storyline regarding the several conflicts with Jason Todd until he makes
his final return as the "Red Hood". Grayson temporarily took over as
Batman (while Wayne was traveling through time), using the aid of Damian
Wayne, making his newish appearance as "Robin", to defeat and imprison
Todd. With Bruce Wayne's return, Grayson went back to being
Nightwing.

Jason Todd

[Cover to Batman #369 (December 1983). Pencils by Dick Giordano.] 
was initially hesitant to turn Grayson into Nightwing and to replace him
with a new Robin. To minimize the change, they made the new Robin, Jason
Peter Todd, who first appeared in Batman #357 (1983), similar to a
young Grayson. Like Dick Grayson, Jason Todd was the son of circus
acrobats murdered by a criminal (this time the Batman adversary Killer
Croc), and then adopted by Bruce Wayne. In this incarnation, he was
red-haired and unfailingly cheerful, and wore his circus costume to
fight crime until Dick Grayson presented him with a Robin suit of his
own. At that point, he dyed his hair black. After the mini-series
Crisis on Infinite Earths, much of  continuity was redone.
Dick Grayson's origin, years with Batman, and growth into Nightwing
remained mostly unchanged; but Todd's character was completely revised.
He was now a black-haired street orphan who first encountered Batman
when he attempted to steal tires from the Batmobile. Batman saw to it
that he was placed in a school for troubled youths. Weeks later, after
Dick Grayson became Nightwing and Todd proved his crime-fighting worth
by helping Batman catch a gang of robbers, Batman offered Todd the
position as Robin. Readers never truly bonded with Todd and, in 1988, 
made the controversial decision to poll readers using a 1-900 number as
to whether or not Todd should be killed. The event received more
attention in the mainstream media than any other comic book event before
it. Readers voted "yes" by a small margin (5,343 to 5,271) and Todd was
subsequently murdered by the Joker in the storyline, A Death in the
Family, in which the psychopath beat the youngster severely with a
crowbar, and left him in a warehouse rigged with a bomb. Jason Todd
later returned as the new Red Hood (the original alias of the Joker)
when he was brought back to life due to reality being altered. After the
continuity changes as a result of the  relaunch "The New 52",
Jason becomes a leader of the Outlaws, a superhero team that includes
Starfire and Arsenal.

Tim Drake

[Portion of the cover of Batman vol. 1 #465 (July, 1991). Art by Norm
Breyfogle and is based on the cover to Batman #9 by Jack Burnley.] 
Comics was left uncertain about readers' decision to kill Todd,
wondering if they felt Batman should be a lone vigilante, disliked Todd
specifically, or just wanted to see if  would actually kill the
character. In addition, the 1989 Batman film did not feature Robin,
giving  a reason to keep him out of the comic book series for
marketing purposes. Regardless, Batman editor Denny O'Neil introduced a
new Robin. The third Robin, Timothy Drake, first appeared in a flashback
in Batman #436 (1989). Drake was a young boy who had followed the
adventures of Batman and Robin ever since witnessing the murder of the
Flying Graysons. This served to connect Drake to Grayson, establishing a
link that  hoped would help readers accept this new Robin. Drake
surmised their secret identities with his amateur but instinctive
detective skills and followed their careers closely. Tim has stated on
numerous occasions that he wishes to become "The World's Greatest
Detective", a title currently belonging to the Dark Knight. Batman
himself has stated that one day Drake will surpass him as a detective.
Despite his combat skills not being the match of Grayson's (although
there are some similarities, in that they are far superior to Todd's
when he was Robin), his detective skills more than make up for this. In
addition, Batman supplied him with a new armored costume which included
full leggings to give Drake improved protection. Tim was introduced as a
happy medium between the first two Robins in that, from the readers'
point of view, he is neither overly well behaved like Dick Grayson nor
overly impudent like Jason Todd. Drake is the first Robin to have his
own comic book series, where he fought crime on his own. Tim Drake, as
Robin, co-founded the superhero team Young Justice in the absence of the
Teen Titans of Dick Grayson's generation, but would then later re-form
the Teen Titans after Young Justice disbanded following a massive
sidekick crossover during which Donna Troy was killed. Tim served as
leader of this version of the Titans until 2009, at which point he quit
due to the events of Batman R.I.P._ Following the events of Infinite
Crisis and 52 Tim altered the colors of his Robin costume to simply
red and black in tribute to his best friend, Superboy (Kon-El), who died
fighting Earth-Prime Superboy. After Batman's disappearance following
the events of Final Crisis and Battle For The Cowl and his son
Damian becoming Grayson's Robin, Tim taking the identity of Red Robin.
After the continuity changes as a result of the  relaunch,
history was altered so that Tim Drake never took up the Robin mantle
after Jason Todd's death, feeling that it would be inappropriate.
Instead, he served as Batman's sidekick under the name of Red Robin.

Stephanie Brown

[Promotional art for Robin (vol. 2) #126 (July 2004) cover. Art by
Damion Scott.] Stephanie Brown, Tim Drake's girlfriend and the costumed
adventurer previously known as the Spoiler, volunteered for the role of
Robin upon Tim's resignation. Batman fired the Girl Wonder for not
obeying his orders to the letter on two separate occasions. Stephanie
then stole one of Batman's incomplete plans to control Gotham crime and
executed it. Trying to prove her worthiness, Brown inadvertently set off
a gang war on the streets of Gotham. While trying to help end the war,
Brown was captured and tortured by the lunatic crime boss Black Mask.
She managed to escape but apparently died shortly afterwards due to the
severity of her injuries. Tim Drake keeps a memorial for her in his cave
hideout underneath Titans Tower in San Francisco. She appeared alive and
stalking Tim, after his return from traveling around the globe with his
mentor. It turned out that Dr. Leslie Thompkins had faked Stephanie's
death in an effort to protect her. For years she operated on and off
as The Spoiler, but is now Barbara Gordon's replacement as Batgirl. She
has her own series as well as making appearances throughout various
Batman and Batman spin-off series. Her time as Robin was retconned after
the Flashpoint event.

Damian Wayne

[Damian Wayne as Robin. Promotional art for Batman and Robin (vol. 1)
#1 (June 2009) cover. Art by Frank Quitely.] Damian Wayne was the child
of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, thus the grandson of immortal
terrorist Ra's al Ghul. Batman was unaware of his son's existence for
years until Talia left Damian in his care. Damian was violent and
lacking in discipline and morality, and was trained by the League of
Assassins. Learning to kill at a young age, Damian's murderous behavior
created a troubled relationship with his father, who vowed never to take
a life. Originally conceived to become a host for his maternal
grandfather's soul as well as a pawn against the Dark Knight, Batman
saved his child from this fate which forced Ra's to inhabit his own
son's body, and Damian was affectionate to his father. After Batman's
apparent death during Final Crisis,_ Talia left her son under Dick
Grayson and Alfred Pennyworth's care and Damian was deeply affected by
his father's absence. In the first issue of "Battle for the Cowl",
Damian was driving the Batmobile and was attacked by Poison Ivy and
Killer Croc. Damian was rescued by Nightwing who then tries to escape
but was shot down by Black Mask's men. Nightwing tried to fight the
thugs, but the thugs were shot by Jason Todd. After a fight between
Nightwing and Todd, Todd eventually shot Damian in the chest. In the
final issue of the series, Alfred made Damian into Robin. Damian's first
task as Robin was to rescue Tim. After "Battle for the Cowl", Grayson
adopted the mantle of Batman, and instead of having Tim (who he viewed
as an equal, rather than a protégé) remain as Robin, he gave the role to
Damian, who he felt needed the training that his father would have given
him.

Following Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne and Flashpoint events,
Bruce Wayne returned to his role as Batman while Dick resumed as
Nightwing. As of the "New 52", Damian continued to work with his father,
but temporarily gave up being Robin (as his mother put a price on his
head), and went under the identity of Red Bird. Damian met his end at
the hands of Heretic, an aged-clone of Damian working for Leviathan,
bravely giving up his life. Despite his present status as deceased,
Damian starred in his own mini-series, Damian: Son of Batman,_ written
and drawn by Andy Kubert, set in a future where Damian is on the path to
become Batman after his father fell victim to a trap set by the Joker.
Batman eventually started a difficult quest to resurrect him, returning
Damian to life with Darkseid's Chaos Shard.


Other versions

Bruce Wayne

A Batman story from the 1950s featured the young Bruce Wayne assuming
the identity of Robin, complete with the original costume, in order to
learn the basics of detective work from a famous detective named Harvey
Harris. The purpose of the secret identity was to prevent Harris from
learning Wayne's true motivation for approaching him, which could have
led to the detective attempting to discourage the boy from pursuing his
obsession. Though this story remained canonical through the most of
the 1980s (it was revisited in the Untold Legend of the Batman
miniseries in 1980), it was revised post-Crisis to edit out any
reference to Bruce Wayne having ever called himself "Robin" or worn any
costume before he finally donned his Batman costume as an adult.
John Byrne later worked this aspect into his non-canonical story
Superman & Batman: Generations.

Post-Crisis, there was one instance in continuity when Bruce Wayne
adopted the Robin persona. In Batboy & Robin, a tie-in special to the
 storyline Sins of Youth, Bruce and Tim Drake, the third
Robin, had their ages magically switched. In an effort to keep up the
illusion of Batman, Bruce had Tim adopt the Batman identity while he is
forced to be Robin.

Earth-Two Robin, Before Crisis on Infinite Earths

[Pre-Crisis Earth-Two Robin.] On Earth-Two, home of the Golden Age
version of 's superheroes, Dick Grayson continued to be Robin even as
an adult, having no successors, and even after Batman's death. His
allies as a boy included the All-Star Squadron along with Batwoman and
Flamebird.

By the 1960s, Grayson had become an adult, and was a lawyer and the
ambassador to South Africa. He adopted a more Batman-like costume, but
still fought crime as Robin. This adult version of Dick Grayson debuted
in Justice League of America #55, where he also became a member of the
Justice Society of America. Although in semi-retirement for a time, he
was called back to active duty when he rejoined the Justice Society
during the period when he, Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid, assisted
them as The Super Squad.

He appeared to have died during the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite
Earths, in which the  Multiverse was reduced to one Universe, and
this version of Grayson, as well as the Earth-Two Batman, were deemed
never to have existed. The Earth-2 concept was revived and reimagined
twice subsequently, following the comic books 52 (2006–7) and
Flashpoint (2011).

Elseworlds versions

Elseworlds versions of  characters are ones that exist in alternate
timelines or realities that take place in entirely self-contained
continuities. In Elseworlds Robin has been a German immigrant during
WWII named Richart Graustark, Bruce Wayne Jr (the son of Julia Madison
and Bruce Wayne), a robot called "The Toy Wonder", a genetically
enhanced ape named Rodney, a samurai named Tengu, a pirate's cabin boy,
a girl traveling via space ship to a far off colonial planet, Bruce
Wayne's nephew Thomas Wayne III, MI-6 agent Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce
Wayne's sister during the Reign of Terror in France, and a Native
American named Red Bird.

Carrie Kelley

In Frank Miller's non-canonical The Dark Knight Returns, the role of
Robin is filled by Carrie Kelley, a thirteen-year-old girl. She becomes
Robin, and is accepted by the Batman after she saves his life. Unlike
the previous Robins, Carrie is not an orphan, but she appears to have
rather neglectful parents who are never actually depicted (one of them
mutters "Didn't we have a kid?" while their daughter is watching the
fierce battle between Batman and the Mutants). It is hinted through
their dialogue that they were once activists and possibly hippies during
the 1960s, but have since become apathetic stoners. She was the first
female Robin and the first Robin with living parents. In the sequel,
Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, 2001, Carrie dons the identity
of CATGIRL but still works as Batman's second-in-command.

She was also featured in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series
entitled "Legends of the Dark Knight". She then appeared in Batman: The
Brave and the Bold{{'s}} episode entitled "Batman Dies At Dawn!" along
with Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, and Damian
Wayne. Kelley joined the New 52  universe in Batman and Robin #19,
in a story titled Batman and Red Robin.

Talon

Crime Syndicate version of Robin on Earth-3, associate of Owlman. Talon
refers to Owlman as his father, whether he is the biological son of
Thomas Wayne II or an alternate version of Jason Todd or Tim Drake is
unknown. Talon first appeared in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #32 (March
2006).

52 Multiverse

In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally
consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown
is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of Mister Mind "eating" aspects
of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis
Earth-2, including Robin among other Justice Society of America
characters. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate
universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2. However, in the Justice
Society of America Annual #1, published in the summer of 2008, Silver
Scarab explains that the events of the Crisis are remembered by the
people of this Earth-2, and from their perspective, Earth-2 seemed to
be the only Earth to have survived the Crisis, raising theories as to
whether or not Earth-2 was really destroyed, or was perhaps replaced by
a new Earth-2. Indeed, in Justice Society of America #20, published in
December 2008, Starman explains that during the re-expansion of the 
Multiverse, Earth-2 was reborn "along with everyone on it", including
Robin.

Following Flashpoint (2011) and The New 52 reboot, this Earth is
replaced by another reimagining of Earth 2, one where Batman's daughter
Helena Wayne served as Robin until an incident five years prior to the
relaunch sent her to 's primary continuity, Earth-0, where she works
as Huntress. The 2014 series Earth 2: World's End establishes that
Dick Grayson never served as Robin on this Earth, and was instead a
reporter who married Barbara Gordon and had a son. During Darkseid's
invasion of Earth 2, Barbara is killed, and Dick is trained in how to
fight by Ted Grant and goes on a mission to find his missing son.


Robin monthlies

The first Robin miniseries was printed in 1992 following Tim Drake's
debut as Robin. The series centered around Tim's continued training and
set up villains linked to the character. It was followed up by another
series Robin II: Joker's Wild which pitted Tim against his
predecessor's murderer the Joker. With Batman out of town, it was up to
Tim and Alfred to end the Joker's latest crime spree. A final
miniseries, Robin III: Cry of Huntress wrapped up the trilogy, teaming
Tim with the Huntress. In 1993, the success of the three miniseries led
to the ongoing Robin series which ran 183 issues until 2009. The title
was replaced by a Batman and Robin series following the Battle for
the Cowl mini-series, as well as an ongoing Red Robin monthly which
continues the story of Tim Drake.

The ongoing Robin series has taken part in a number of crossovers with
other comics, especially Batman and related series. These include:

-   Robin #1:
-   Robin #7: Knightquest: The Search
-   Robin #8: KnightsEnd
-   Robin #9: Knightfall: Aftermath
-   Robin #10–13: Prodigal
-   Robin #14: Troika
-   Robin #27–28: Batman: Contagion
-   Robin #32–33: Batman: Legacy
-   Robin #52–53: Batman: Cataclysm
-   Robin #67–73: Batman: No Man's Land
-   Robin #86: Batman: Officer Down
-   Robin #95: Joker: The Last Laugh
-   Robin #98–99: Bruce Wayne: Murderer?
-   Robin #129–131: Batman: War Games
-   Robin #168–169: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul
-   Robin #175–176: Batman R.I.P.

In addition, two Robin related series will launch in June 2015: We Are
Robin, featuring writer Lee Bermejo and artists Rob Haynes and Khary
Randolph, and detailing multiple teenagers in Gotham who take up the
mantle of Robin; and Robin, Son of Batman, written and drawn by Patrick
Gleason, showing the individual adventures of Damian Wayne.


Reception

According to Entertainment Weekly in 2008, Robin is one of the
"greatest sidekicks".


Portrayals

Robin (Dick Grayson) was portrayed by Douglas Croft and Johnny Duncan,
respectively, in the 1943 and 1949 fifteen chapter Batman serials.
Burt Ward played him in the 1966–1968 Batman television series and the
related 1966 film. In the two live-action movies Batman Forever and
Batman & Robin, he was played by Chris O'Donnell.

The Dick Grayson version of Robin also appears in Batman: The Animated
Series, voiced by Loren Lester. Grayson is replaced by Tim Drake,
played by Mathew Valencia, in the subsequent series The New Batman
Adventures.

The animated series Teen Titans features Robin (voiced by Scott
Menville) as the leader of a team of young heroes; it is hinted in
several episodes that this Robin is Dick Grayson. In the season two
episode "Fractured", a version of Bat-Mite is introduced who claims to
be Robin's "DNA buddy" (genetic twin). Bat-Mite gives his name as
Nosyarg Kcid ("Dick Grayson" spelled backwards). In another episode,
Raven reads Robin's mind and sees a man and a woman falling from a
trapeze (an event known only to have happened to Grayson and not to any
other Robin). In another episode, Starfire travels to the future and
discovers that Robin has taken the identity of Nightwing. Menville
reprises his role as Robin in Teen Titans Go!_.

Robin is also seen in the 1987 Zeller's commercial, which features the
infamous catchphrase, "Well said, Robin!".

Robin is voiced by Jesse McCartney in Young Justice.

Robin is portrayed by Nick Lang in Holy Musical B@man!_. His portrayal
is based mainly on Burt Ward's Dick Grayson.
