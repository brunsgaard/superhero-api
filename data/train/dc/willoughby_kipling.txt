WILLOUGHBY KIPLING is a fictional character in the  and Vertigo
Comics universe, created by Grant Morrison.


Publication history

Kipling appeared mostly in Doom Patrol, originally intended as
John Constantine, but at the time  editorial policy forbade his use
outside the Vertigo line; Kipling was created as a substitute, and was
based upon Richard E. Grant's title character from the British cult film
Withnail & I. He appeared intermittently, helping the team against
various threats, such as the Cult of the Unwritten Book and the
Candlemaker. He is a member of the mystic Knights Templar, a coward who
practises a bizarre form of black magic and is a self-proclaimed expert
on the occult.

Later, Kipling's voice-over appears in JLA Classified #15 (February
2006). He and several other magic-users use their knowledge to assist
Oracle and the JLA defeat a mystic threat.
