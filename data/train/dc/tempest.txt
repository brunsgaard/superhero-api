published by . NOTOC_


Joshua Clay

The first character with the superhero title, Clay is an
African-American member of the second Doom Patrol. Along with Captain
Comet, he was one of the few  heroes initially identified as
a mutant.

Clay was murdered by a temporarily deranged Niles Caulder (The Chief) in
Doom Patrol. His death was not undone by the events of Infinite
Crisis, as he will become a Black Lantern.


Christopher Champion

The second hero was Christopher Champion, son of Martin Champion and
member of the second Atari Force team. He was born with the power to
traverse the Multiverse without the team's ship, the Scanner One.


Garth

The third character bearing the same superhero title, Garth is initially
known as AQUALAD, Aquaman's teenage partner. Like many other such
'kid sidekicks' popular in the Silver Age, his powers were originally
very similar to his mentor's. As Aqualad, Garth is a founding member of
the original Teen Titans. Later, Garth becomes Tempest, gains his own
set of powers and skills, very different from Aquaman's, and learns that
his origin is similar to that of Aquaman.
