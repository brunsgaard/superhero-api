Fictional character biography

Jim Harper

[Guardian (Jim Harper) and the Newsboy Legion's debut. ] Jim Harper is a
police officer in Metropolis' Suicide Slum who became a vigilante to
catch crooks that the law could not prosecute, describing himself as
guarding society from criminals. He was trained to fighting condition by
ex-boxer Joe Morgan (the same man who trained two other mystery men,
Wilat and the first Atom). He was aided by a group of boys known as
the Newsboy Legion, to whom he was, literally, a guardian, having
volunteered to take them in rather than allowing them to be sent to
prison; he did so on the grounds that they were basically good kids who
just needed a chance. The Legion grew up to become the heads of the
Cadmus Project, subsequently saving Harper's life by transferring his
mind from his old, dying body into a younger clone of himself.

It was later revealed that Jim Harper was the great-uncle of Roy Harper,
who became Green Arrow's sidekick under the name of "Speedy".

Other relatives include his niece Roberta "Famous Bobby" Harper, who was
briefly a member of the second Newsboy Legion  and Jamie Harper, an
African American grandniece working for the Gotham City Police
Department. She worked as Robin's personal contact in the GCPD, similar
to the role Commissioner James Gordon plays for Batman. After helping
Robin and Jason Bard expose two dirty cops in the GCPD, Jamie Harper was
promoted to Detective Specialist and has since transferred to the
Metropolis Science Police.

Golden Guardian

In Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #135 (January 1971), Jack Kirby
reintroduced the boys of the now grown-up Newsboy Legion as supporting
characters connected with the DNA Project (later Project Cadmus), a
genetics research laboratory. One of the Project's experiments was a
clone of the late Jim Harper, who took up his predecessor's role, and
became the Project's Head of Security as the GOLDEN GUARDIAN.
Post-Crisis this character was simply known as the Guardian.

Harper remained Cadmus' Head of Security even after the former Newsboys
had left. Eventually, he too was killed, although another clone was
created and rapidly aged to adulthood, retaining all his predecessor's
memories. This Guardian disappeared along with the rest of Cadmus
following an altercation with Amanda Waller and President Luthor, and
his whereabouts are unknown.

Post-Infinite Crisis

Following Infinite Crisis, the Guardian clone's backstory was
retconned. As Dubbilex explained to Jimmy Olsen, Jim Harper was not
killed in the line of duty, but shot by Cadmus' first head of security,
Jonathan Drew, upon discovering the clone was already being created.

It was also revealed that the original Guardian clone had left Cadmus
early on, and was now living in the town of Warpath on the Mexican
border, where he assisted Sheriff Greg Saunders. Subsequent appearances
of the Guardian had been new clones, each of which died within a
year.

The original Guardian clone has decided to move to Metropolis with Gwen,
his adopted daughter (in fact, an adolescent female clone of himself
that he rescued), during the New Krypton storyline.

Science Police team leaders DuBarry and Daniels, along with several
prison guards, were killed during the events of New Krypton when a team
of Kandorians led by Commander Gor assaulted Stryker's Island and
demanded custody of Parasite. The Science Police Control 'Rachel'
tasked Guardian to act as a liaison between the Metropolis Police
Department and a coalition of superheroes in bringing justice for the
fallen science police officers and prison guards. After the
Kandorians left Earth, Guardian was appointed Field Commander of the
Science Police, as replacement for DuBarry and Daniels, due in part to
his cloned memories of Jim Harper as a police officer and Guardian as a
superhero. He was asked by Superman to help Mon-El, offering him a
job with the Science Police and mentoring him on how to be a hero.

The issues of Detective Comics published during the One Year Later
event, reveals that Harper has a grandniece, Jamie, formerly a
detective of Gotham City Police Department and a former associate of
Robin III.

The Guardian later travels to the JLA Watchtower to warn the Justice
League after finding a teleportation device in Metropolis. While on the
Watchtower, the heroes are attacked by Prometheus, who blinds the
Guardian. In the aftermath of the attack, Guardian and Mon-El are
recruited by Kimiyo Hoshi to join the Justice League. On his first
and only mission with the team, the Guardian helps battle Doctor
Impossible's gang of villains. After a mere three issues, the Guardian
was written out of the book due to writer James Robinson's desire to
work with a smaller cast.

Following the events of War of the Supermen, Harper abandons his role
as the Guardian and takes Jamie (now pregnant with Mon-El's child) off
to an unknown destination.

Mal Duncan

In Teen Titans #44 (November 1976), the previously uncostumed Titan
Mal Duncan took the name of the Guardian, wearing the original's outfit
and an exoskeleton with strength augmenting abilities. The two Guardians
finally met in Superman Family #s 191-193 (Sept 78-Feb 79), when Mal
helped rescue the Harper clone from Adam, an evil clone created using
genetic material from both Harper and Dubbilex who had taken control of
the DNA Project.

The Crisis on Infinite Earths removed Duncan's career as the Guardian,
although he did appear briefly in his Guardian costume during the Crisis
itself.

Mal made appearances in the two season show Young Justice. Mal was
shown to be the Boyfriend and later fianc√© of Bumblebee. He took the
identity of Guardian (after Jim Harper) in order to protect The Hall Of
Justice from an attack.

Jake Jordan

In 2005, Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers megaseries introduced a new
character based on the original Guardian, Jake Jordan the Manhattan
Guardian.


Powers and abilities

The Guardian possesses exceptional combat and tactical skills. He was
trained in many forms of fighting, and excelled at gymnastics, thinking
quickly on his feet, and deduction. His only weapons are his golden
helmet and shield. Guardian often used a customized motorcycle equipped
with autopilot and a set of video cameras filming from various angles
and recorded on videodisc.

The Harper clone possesses enhanced strength and reflexes, and an
accelerated healing factor. The Harper clone's exact strength level is
unknown but has demonstrated the ability to hurt Superboy (who he
trained in hand-to-hand combat) and Kryptonians from Kandor. As an agent
of Cadmus, Jim Harper also has access to the wondrous Whiz Wagon. The
Hairies (a super-advanced tribe of techno-wizards, originally genetic
creations of Donovan, who left Cadmus) built the Whiz Wagon to handle
every situation. It can adapt to every terrain, fly, and even go
underwater. The Wagon can be remote controlled or pre-programmed and is
equipped with a set of powerful weapons and various gadgets.


Other versions

In the Frank Miller graphic novel Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes
Again, the Guardian is one of the superheroes killed by Dick Grayson.
It is implied that he had a daughter with Lois Lane named Lana
Harper-Lane, a television reporter.

The Guardian's golden shield survives to the alternative future of the
853rd century; it is kept by that timeline's Batman.

A bearded version of Guardian exists on the post-Flashpoint Earth-23 as
a member of a predominantly African American Justice League.

Television

-   A teenaged version of Guardian appears as a supervillain under the
    name of PRIVATE H.I.V.E. in the Teen Titans animated series voiced
    by Greg Cipes. As his name implies, he is a student of the H.I.V.E.
    Academy (as opposed to Cadmus) and is a member of the show's version
    of the Fearsome Five. Private H.I.V.E. possesses an identical
    costume and shield to Guardian's albeit with a H.I.V.E. crest
    located on his chest, belt and the center of the shield. Like
    Guardian, Private H.I.V.E is extremely disciplined and militaristic,
    often ending sentences with the word "Sir".

    Nightwing, and Kid Flash into holding an intervention for Red Arrow
    (who is still looking for the true Speedy). Guardian even admits
    that he is not sure who his identity of Jim Harper was. In the
    episode "Cornered", Mal Duncan officially takes over as the new
    Guardian after finding Jim Harper's costume and shield in the Hall
    of Justice during an attack.

    replacement by the Martian Manhunter. At the end of the episode,
    Harper tries to take both the Martian Manhunter and Alex Danvers
    (DEO agent and foster sister of Supergirl) to be experimented on at
    Project Cadmus only to be thwarted by Supergirl and Lucy Lane. At
    the end of the episode, Martian Manhunter erases Harper's memories
    of the event and learns that Alex Danvers' father is also at Project
