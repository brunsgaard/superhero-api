with the reboot).


Publication history

Fawcett Comics

[The first appearance of Mary , from Captain  Adventures
#18 (1942). Art by C. C. Beck.] Mary  was introduced into Fawcett
Comics'  Family franchise a year after a young male counterpart,
Captain  Jr., made his debut. Artist Marc Swayze based Mary
's design and personality upon American actress Judy Garland.
Mary was introduced in Captain  Adventures #18 as Mary
Bromfield, a girl who discovers she is the long lost sister of Captain
's alter ego Billy Batson.

Soon after her introduction, Mary  headlined Wow Comics, and by
1945 had her own Mary  book. She also appeared in The 
Family book with Captain  and Captain  Jr. In her solo
adventures, Mary soon gained sidekicks in her kindly Uncle , who
was not actually her uncle nor a , and his similarly nonpowered
niece, Freckles . Uncle  was eventually made the 
Family’s manager, and also served as Mary’s guardian.

Just before the  Family's adventures ceased publication in 1953,
Mary ’s costume and appearance were altered: the neckline of her
blouse was lowered slightly, her hair was shortened, and she now wore
yellow slippers instead of the customary  Family yellow boots.
After Fawcett canceled their superhero comics line because of a
copyright infringement lawsuit with National Comics (later ),
Mary  and her teammates went unseen for years.



1973-1985

In 1972,  licensed the rights to the , and revived them
in a new comic series called Shazam!_. Mary, Cap, and Junior appeared
in both new stories and reprints of their classic stories. According to
Shazam #1 the Sivanas had put the  family into suspended animation
for 20 years, along with themselves (by mistake) and much of the
supporting cast. The comic book was canceled by 1978, and the Shazam!_
stories were relegated to the back pages of World's Finest Comics
(from 1979 to 1982) and Adventure Comics (from 1982 to 1983). After
the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, Captain ’s origin
was rebooted in the Shazam: The New Beginning miniseries in 1987. The
 Family was written out of the Shazam!_ mythos, and neither Mary
Batson nor Mary  appeared in  for several years.

1994-1999

Mary Batson was reintroduced in The Power of Shazam!_ graphic novel by
Jerry Ordway in 1994. An ongoing series followed in the next year, and
Mary  was introduced into the modern  Universe with a new origin
story in Power of Shazam!_ #4.

When calling upon her powers, Mary is transformed into an adult
resembling her late mother (in the same way that Billy resembles his
father when in  form). Mary shares the title of Captain 
with her brother. Various characters in the series distinguish the two
by gender when addressing them, addressing Mary as "the lady Captain
".

At first, Mary’s costume was the same as her original one. However,
beginning with Power of Shazam!_ #28, Mary donned a white costume to
distinguish herself from her brother. The color change was retained for
most future uses of the character during the next decade.

2000s

After the Power of Shazam!_ series ended in 1999, Mary’s superpowered
alter ego was officially rechristened "Mary ." In 2002 she had
lunch with Supergirl in "The Clubhouse of Solitude", in the spoof
graphic anthology "Bizarro Comics". Since then, she has guest-starred in
both Superman and Supergirl comics. In 2003, Mary became a member of
an offshoot of the Justice League known as the Super Buddies in the
Formerly Known as the Justice League miniseries, which juxtaposed her
Golden Age-era personality with the modern-day world for comic effect.

Mary  appears briefly in several stories relating to 's
2005-2006 Infinite Crisis crossover. Mary also appeared in 's weekly
limited series 52, with her most substantial appearance being in 52
#16 as the maid of honor at the wedding of Black Adam and Isis, two
Shazam!_-related characters. She was defeated by Black Adam during
World War III () along with the other .

In 2006,  began a revamp of the Shazam!_ mythos with Judd Winick and
Howard Porter's Trials of Shazam!_ limited series. The series began
with a preview within the pages of Brave New World #1 in June 2006, in
which Mary Batson loses her powers, suffers a three-mile fall, and falls
into a coma. This set up Mary's appearances as a main character in
Countdown, a weekly  series which served as the successor to 52.
During the course of the series, head writer Paul Dini and his
collaborators had Mary acquire the powers of Black Adam, which give her
a new look including a form-fitting long-sleeved black uniform and skirt
with black lace-up boots. While the series tracked the character's
struggle between good and evil, due to manipulation by supervillainesses
Eclipso and Granny Goodness (promotional material for the series used
the catchphrase "Seduction of the Innocent," a reference to Fredric
Wertham's book of the same title), Mary emerged from the series under
the influence of Superman villain Darkseid.

This darker Mary  appears in 's 2008 crossover series Final
Crisis, written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by J. G. Jones, as a
Female Fury, with another design change (to match the styles of the
other Furies) and a fully evil personality due to possession by the New
God Desaad. Though defeated by Freddy Freeman/Shazam before end of
the Final Crisis miniseries, the evil Mary appeared again in the
"Black Adam and Isis" arc featured in Justice Society of America (vol.
3) #23–25, by the end of which she has lost her powers and returned to
being a normal teenage girl.

2010s

In 2011, following its Flashpoint company-wide event,  made sweeping
continuity changes to some comic book series and minor ones to others,
as part of its relaunch event "The New 52". Captain , now known as
Shazam, received a new origin story as part of the backup feature in the
relaunched Justice League. Mary does not feature in the new continuity
until Justice League #8 (2012), and is not transformed into a 
for the first time until Justice League #21 (2013), when Billy directs
his powers into her, Freddy and three other foster siblings during a
fray with Black Adam.

Original Fawcett origin

Mary 's first appearance in Captain  Adventures #18 also
relayed her origin story.

As infants, twins Billy and Mary Batson were nursed by a woman named
Sarah Primm. When the Batsons' parents die in a car accident, Primm was
required to send both children to an orphanage. However, Primm is
determined to at least give one of the children a home, and arranges for
Mary to secretly take the place of another baby girl who had suddenly
died while under Primm's care. As a result, Billy is sent to an
orphanage while his sister is raised by the wealthy Mrs. Bromfield.

Several years later, Billy Batson becomes a teenage radio announcer.
While hosting an on-air quizbowl, he receives an urgent letter from
Sarah Primm, now on her death bed, requesting his presence. Billy goes
to see her during a break, and Primm tells him the secret of his
long-lost sister. To help him find Mary, Primm gives Billy a locket
broken in half and tells the boy with her last breaths that Mary wears
the other half.

After the quizbowl broaast is over, Billy tells his best friend Freddy
Freeman about his sister and the locket. Billy then recalls that one of
the quizbowl contestants, a rich girl named Mary Bromfield, wore a
broken locket. He and Freddy trail Mary’s limousine in their
superpowered forms of Captain  and Captain  Jr. and find
themselves called into service to save Mary from a gang of kidnappers.

Captain  then learns that Mary's locket matches his own, and that
she is indeed Billy’s sister. The  reveal their secret identities
to Mary, who wonders if, since she is Billy’s twin, she could become a
 by saying the magic word "Shazam". Billy, however, is assured
that “Old Shaz—er—you know who—wouldn’t give his powers to a girl!”

Just then, the kidnappers awaken then bind and gag Billy and Freddy,
preventing them from saying their magic words. Mary realizes that Billy
cannot say Shazam, inadvertently saying the word. She is then struck by
a magic lightning bolt and transformed into a super-powered version of
herself, later christened "Mary " by her brother. She then defeats
the thugs by herself, realizing that she is invulnerable to bullets when
they fire at her and has super strength, and frees Billy and Freddy.
Shazam then reveals the goddesses she gets her powers from.

Modified  origin

[Mary  in Formerly Known as the Justice League #1 (2003). Art by
Kevin Maguire and Josef Rubinstein.] Mary 's updated  origin was
presented in the Power of Shazam!_ graphic novel and ongoing series,
written by Jerry Ordway.

Prominent archaeologists C.C. and Marilyn Batson are assigned by the
Sivana expedition on an excursion to Egypt. They take along their young
daughter Mary, but are forced to leave their son Billy in America with
C.C.'s half-brother. The elder Batsons are killed by their associate
Theo Adam, who then kidnaps Mary. Upon Theo Adam's return to the United
States, Adam’s sister, a maid named Sarah Primm, takes Mary into her
care. Primm arranges for her childless employers, Nick and Nora
Bromfield, to illegally adopt Mary. As Mary Bromfield, the young girl
grows up living an idyllic life in a wealthy family, but continuously
has dreams of another family with a brother she has never seen.

Meanwhile, Billy eventually finding himself on the streets, and is given
the power to become Captain . He learns that Mary is still alive,
but after four years of searching, neither he nor his benefactor, the
wizard Shazam, can find the girl. The only thing Billy has to remember
Mary by is her favorite toy, a "Tawky Tawny" doll, which was shipped to
America with the Batsons’ possessions after their murders.

As a young teenager, Mary enters a regional spelling bee held in Fawcett
City and emceed by Billy, who works as an on-air reporter for WHIZ
radio. After saving Mary from kidnappers twice as Captain , Billy
notices how much Mary Bromfield reminds him of Mary Batson and has an
undercover cop named “Muscles” McGinnis retrieve the girl’s forged
adoption record. Learning that Mary is indeed his sister, Billy tries to
figure out a way to let Mary know he is her brother. The old "Tawky
Tawny" doll suddenly transforms into a full-sized humanoid tiger and
comes to life, instructing Billy to take it to Mary. As Captain ,
Billy flies out to the Bromfields’ hometown of Fairfield to deliver the
doll and the adoption papers to Mary.

Captain  arrives at the Bromfield estate and changes back to Billy
Batson to deliver the package, but is immediately kidnapped by the thugs
who helped Primm forge Mary’s adoption records. Mary, not having seen
Billy, takes the package and opens it, discovering the adoption records
and the Tawky Tawny doll. Once again, the doll comes to life and
instructs the bewildered girl to say the magic word "Shazam" and save
her brother. Mary complies and is transformed by a bolt of magic
lightning into a superpowered doppelganger of her deceased mother. She
saves Billy, who transforms into Captain  to help Mary defeat the
thugs, but the two  cannot save Sarah Primm, who is murdered by
one of the thugs.

The Trials of Shazam!_ and Countdown

[Mary  acquires Black Adam's powers in Countdown #47 (June 6,
2007).]

In the eleven page preview to Judd Winick and Howard Porter's Trials of
Shazam!_ limited series appearing in 's Brave New World one-shot
comic (June 2006), Mary  loses her powers in mid-flight as an
after-effect of the death of the wizard Shazam by the Spectre in Day of
Vengeance #6, and falls from a height of three miles (this contradicts
her appearances in the 52 series, as she appears in that series using
her powers, despite 52 taking place chronologically after Day of
Vengeance). Mary survives the fall but goes into a coma, and Freddy
Freeman, who lost the power to become Captain  Jr. in the same
way, has her transported to a hospital in New York City where he can
keep watch over her. He spends all his money to help her.

In Countdown #51, Mary is released from the hospital. She finds that
she is still powerless and a note left by Freddy Freeman with a nurse
asks her not to look for him as he is trying to get the powers of Shazam
back, per the orders of . Making her way to Gotham City (despite
being warned by Madame Xanadu to avoid the place in Countdown #50),
Mary stumbles upon the former Kahndaqi embassy while being chased by
violent criminals from the subway, who are killed by Black Adam. Black
Adam angrily threatens her. Mary tells Adam how much she valued her
powers and how she desires to regain them. Adam, bitter over the loss of
his wife Isis and brother-in-law Osiris during the events of 52 as
well as his failure to resurrect the former, gives Mary his powers
instead of killing her. He is transformed into the mortal Teth-Adam,
whom Mary rescues from a wall toppling on him. Mary wears a black
form-fitting costume and wields Adam's powers as a darker, angrier
character. While searching for a tutor to help her harness her power
at the reformed Riddler's advice, she encounters Klarion the Witch boy
in a market for dark magic, who tries to take her power, then Zatanna,
who banishes her from her home after a fight, and then Eclipso, who only
fuels her wild abandon. She uses a rougher justice, such as turning
soldiers to stone and shrinking poachers so their quarries chase them.

Their alliance, however, seems to break down when Eclipso, hoping to
please her master Darkseid, offers the young and pretty Mary as his new
concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid's
arcane knowledge, slay him, and take his place. Mary refuses to sell
herself for more power, beats Eclipso with her own crystal, and flees,
enraged. Eclipso catches up to her and regains the diamond. Eclipso then
departs, leaving Mary alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returns
hoping to finish her off, but Mary is too strong for her.

Mary experiences a change of mind, and upon realizing that Black Adam's
powers are as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divests herself
of them by feeding the lightning bolt into Eclipso, who tries to kill
her and take her power. Both women lose their powers and fall into the
ocean. However, an unpowered Mary lands on Themysciran soil, where Queen
Hippolyta drafts her in the rebellion against Granny Goodness, who is
posing as the goddess Athena.

Mary, Holly Robinson, and Harleen Quinzel manage to reveal Goodness'
deception, and the trio follow her to Apokolips. After escaping the
Female Furies, Mary starts to hear the voices of the gods. The group
manages to free the Olympian gods from an Apokoliptan chamber, and Mary
's powers are restored along with her white costume, which now has
a gray lightning bolt and long sleeves.

After journeying with the Challengers to Earth-51 and witnessing the
Great Disaster occurring there, Mary finally returns home to find
Darkseid waiting for her. Reminding her of how strong she felt using
Black Adam's powers, and claiming the gods do not trust her as much now,
he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts
Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Forager, and Jimmy Olsen, seizing Jimmy to take
him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions Mary's use of the powers,
Mary insists that she is not evil, merely "driven". After Darkseid's
defeat, Mary returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black
 Family. Adam refuses her and, after a big tantrum, she decides to
become a solo superheroine.

Final Crisis

[An evil Mary , possessed by the New God Desaad, battles Wonder
Woman in interior art detail from Final Crisis #3 (of 7), September
2008. Art by J. G. Jones.] Mary returns in Final Crisis, still
apparently in Darkseid's thrall, wearing a new black costume with more
of a punk look. She attacks Wonder Woman, scratching the Amazon's upper
arm and infecting her with an unknown virus delivered from a broken
glass vial bearing a gold Omega symbol. Later, when the heroes of Earth
attack Blüdhaven, Black Adam notes that she's been possessed by one of
the New Gods, a "leering old man". The possessed Mary claims to have a
new dirty magic word, a blasphemous name of power, and to have new gods.
During a heated battle with Supergirl, Black Adam learns that the evil
god Desaad was the one who possessed Mary. Black Adam tries to kill her
but is stopped by Freddy. Later, distracted by hordes of Anti-Life
followers about to attack, Freddy Freeman, the new Captain , grabs
Mary and uses the last of his magic to transform them back to normal.
Though horrified by her actions while possessed by Desaad, and saying
that she never meant for this to happen while crying, she is seen
standing with Freddy with clubs in their hands, awaiting the end of the
world.

Justice Society of America

After the end of the Crisis, Mary is recruited by Black Adam and Isis,
who have taken over the Rock of Eternity formerly lorded over by the
wizard Shazam by defeating Captain  and stealing his powers, using
the magic scarab Shazam used to take Black Adam's powers. During a
battle between Black Adam, Isis, and the Justice Society, who had been
summoned by Billy, the evil Mary  abducts a powerless Billy Batson
and forces him to become a teenage Black  by sharing her powers
and forcing him to say "Mary ".

The two now evil Black  join Adam and Isis, who are intent on
using the power of Shazam to destroy the modern world, in fighting the
Justice Society. When Isis begins attacking the citizens of Adam's
native Khandaq and Adam's friend Atom Smasher, he switches loyalties and
joins the Justice Society's Flash and the spirit of Mary and Billy's
father in helping resurrect the wizard Shazam from the Rock of Finality,
where he has been sealed in stone. Black Adam gives up his powers to
restore the wizard to life. Shazam promptly and angrily takes his powers
back from Mary, Billy, and Isis, turns Teth Adam and Isis to stone, and
closes off all contact to the Rock of Eternity to the Batson kids upon
stating that Billy and Mary failed him. He also threatens to go after
Freddy for stealing his name. The two Batsons are later seen wandering
the streets of Fawcett City, homeless, and wondering what happened to
their father's spirit.

Mary and Billy are briefly seen during the events of Blackest Night,
now living in an apartment in Fawcett City. While watching news reports
of the various heroes and villains being reanimated as Black Lanterns on
their laptop, Mary remarks how scary it is to not have her powers
anymore.

Mary is approached by Blaze, who offers to restore her and Billy's
powers in exchange for her killing Freddy. Mary seems to go along with
the deal, appearing to poison Freddy. However, when Blaze arrives to
claim Freddy's powers, he gets up and attacks her. With a little help
from Mary and Billy, Freddy defeats Blaze and sends her back to hell,
later promising them that he will find a way to restore their lost
powers.

The New 52

[Black Adam confronts the newly created Shazam Family, including Mary
Bromfield (second from right), as seen in Justice League (vol. 2) #21
(August 2013). Art by Gary Frank.] In The New 52 (a reboot of the 
Comics universe), Mary appears as MARY BROMFIELD. She first appeared in
Justice League #8 as part of Billy's new foster family along Mr. and
Mrs. Vasquez, Pedro Pena, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley. She is the
oldest member and possibly the den mother.


Powers and abilities

As Billy's twin, Mary shared Billy's ability to transform into a
superhero by speaking the name of the wizard Shazam. In her petite
superpowered state, Mary  originally wore a red short-sleeved
blouse and red skirt lined with gold trim, which included a lightning
bolt insignia and cape.

The Fawcett and pre-1985 version of Mary  did not derive her
“Shazam” powers from the male mythological figures who empower Billy,
but from a set of female benefactors: Selena for grace, Hippolyta* for
strength, Ariadne (later changed to Artemis, Greek Goddess of the hunt)
for skill, Zephyrus for fleetness (and flight), Aurora (later changed to
Greek Goddess Aphrodite) for beauty, and Minerva for wisdom.

Although these deities were originally described and depicted as
goddesses, Zephyrus is actually a male god. In addition, the list does
not account for all of the superhuman traits shared by Billy and Mary,
specifically Captain 's powers of invulnerability, stamina, and
courage. The original Mary  remained a teenager when she
transformed rather than becoming a mature adult like Billy.

A version of Mary , originating in The Power of Shazam!_, has the
same powers from the same benefactors as her brother (Solomon,
Hercules*, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury). A power-sharing element
was added to the mythos in the Power of Shazam!_ series; one finite
source of power was shared between Mary, Captain , and Captain
 Jr. It should be noted that this power-sharing element has not
been honored by all later appearances of the . Mary loses these
powers in the 2006 Brave New World one-shot special. In early stories,
if she had lost her memory or been transformed, her transformation would
restore her.

In Countdown to Final Crisis (2007–2008), Black Adam gives Mary his
powers. Since Adam was not sharing his powers with anyone else when
he granted them to Mary, and had also been carrying the powers of
his dead wife Isis (who had granted them to him with her death),
Mary is now more powerful than she's ever been. Mary's patron deities
become seven Egyptian gods: Shu, Heru, Amon, Zehuti, Aten, Mehen, and
the "most powerful" Egyptian deity, Isis, which increases her other
powers and allows her to perform magical feats like weather control and
transforming others. Mary's powers continue to expand rapidly as she and
her mentor Eclipso seek new sources of magical power for her, gaining
various new magical powers. She became sufficiently powerful to
withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams. Eventually realizing she had been
corrupted by Eclipso and the powers of Adam's gods, Mary relinquished
these abilities. Mary's powers were restored when she aided the Olympian
Gods in retaining their freedom from Apokolips. Later, her Black Adam
powers were restored, given to her by Darkseid.

In the later Final Crisis miniseries (2008–2009), Mary's body was
further enhanced with genetic technology stolen by the Atomic Knights.
In addition to her impressive magical powers, her empowered form is now
"aged" from late adolescence to adulthood, with clawed hands able to
slice through metal. Later Black Adam restores her powers from the
Egyptian gods. She is able to bestow part of it upon Billy, making him
Black Billy.

Power of Shazam: Formerly, in order to change form, Mary had to call
upon the name of Shazam, thereby invoking spells involving the energies
of those extradimensional beings once known as gods on Earth. When Mary
Batson said the magic word "Shazam!", she would be transformed into Mary
. In her Mary  form, Mary possessed the following
attributes:

  --- ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  S   Wisdom of Solomon      As Mary , Mary had instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge, exceptional photographic recall and mental acuity allowing her to read and decipher hieroglyphics, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously and make intuitive guesses based on limited data to the point her guesses were almost always correct. The wisdom of Solomon also gave Mary clairvoyance and provided her with counsel and advice in times of need. She had knowledge of all languages, ancient and modern, and could hypnotize people.
  H   Strength of Hercules   Mary  had incredible amounts of super strength, was strong enough to lift at least 100 tons, and was able to effortlessly bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects. Mary's strength is enough that she has fought beings such as Captain Atom and Supergirl to a standstill. Her strength parallels that of Superman.
  A   Stamina of Atlas       Using Atlas' endurance and durability, Mary  could withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults. If she were somehow wounded, her godly energies would enable her to recover with superhuman speed and with more finality than mortals. It would take an injury of such magnitude that it dispersed a major portion of her bodily molecules to cause her a physical death. Even then, it might have been possible for a god of significant power, such as Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo, or for a number of Olympian gods of equal power working together, to revive her. Additionally, her Olympian metabolism ensured that she did not need to eat, sleep, or breathe when in Mary  form.
  Z   Power of Zeus          Zeus' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transformed Mary , also enhanced 's other physical and mental abilities, provided physical invulnerability and resistance against most magic spells and attacks, and allowed her to access the Rock of Eternity.  could use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. The magical lightning had many other uses, including creating apparati, restoring damage done to , or acting as fuel for magical spells.
  A   Courage of Achilles    Like the wisdom, this aspect is primarily psychological and gave  superhuman amounts of inner strength from which to draw. She was always supported by an innate and harmonious presence of good will and strength of perseverance so that she never backed down from a challenge.
  M   Speed of Mercury       By channeling Mercury's speed, Mary , while not as fast as the Flash, could fly and move at hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 10 (2 miles a second) while in Earth's atmosphere and could fly at close to light speed through space. She could move fast enough to not register in the normal peripheral range of humans and seemingly vanish and disappear at will. At this speed, her mind processed information on par to a computer or at least on a subliminal level that she was aware of her surroundings. She could also mystically fly through the atmosphere through sheer act of will, enabling her to soar through the atmosphere at sub-orbital levels and travel across the planet. She was immune from the effects of extreme height, such as dizziness and lightheadedness. With effort, she could travel from the earth to the moon, but required extra-precautionary paraphernalia for interstellar travel. Hermes Trismegistus (Greek for "thrice-great Hermes"), an occultist aspect of Hermes/Mercury, also gave her the ability to wield magic and cast spells, though she never used this as Mary , apparently because she did not know how.

Other versions

52

In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed consisting of
52 identical realities. Earth-5 is depicted as home to the  family
characters. As a result of Mister Mind "eating" aspects of this
universe, it takes on aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S.
Although the characters are not named in the panel in which they appear,
a character looking like Mary  is shown. 52 co-author Grant
Morrison has made clear that this alternate universe is not the
pre-Crisis Earth-S.

An evil version of Mary  exists in an alternate universe as a
member of the "Power Posse" (evil analogues of the Super Buddies).
Mistress Mary, as she is called, wears a black variant of Mary's
traditional outfit, almost identical to her costume during the 2007/2008
Countdown series.

Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil

In the 2007 limited series Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil,
written and illustrated by Jeff Smith, Mary Batson is depicted as a
prepubescent child who does not age when she transforms into Mary
.

Mary meets her lost brother in the circus that is attacked by Alligator
Men and is rescued by Captain . With the help of Talky Tawny, a
trickster spirit who changes into various forms but prefers being a
tiger when convenient, the siblings learn they are related. When Billy
transforms into Captain , Mary stands too close to her brother and
is struck by the fringe of the magic lightning. As a result, Mary gains
her  form (which is still at her actual age) that is apparently
based on the aspects of various goddesses, including superior flying
speed to her brother, and powers stemming by a female set of
benefactors. For example, Athena's wisdom is different from Solomon's,
allowing Mary to perceive "life vibrations" and distinguish between
living and non-living beings.

Although she and Billy are kidnapped in their regular form by Doctor
Sivana and Mr. Mind and gagged, Billy escapes and rescues her as Captain
 when she is thrown from the top of a robot by Doctor Sivana and
removes a piece of duct tape from her mouth, allowing her to transform.
When Billy accidentally loses his  powers due to a wormhole
drawing them away, Mary restores them to him by calling down the
lightning and touching him as it strikes.

Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!_

Mary appears as a main character in this follow-up series. As in
Monster Society of Evil, Mary has only a fraction of her brother's
powers and remains a child in super form. Although faster, she is far
less strong. As such, her brother is very protective of her, even in her
 form, although her great courage and cunning are undisputed. She
is also more hyper as Mary .

Justice League Beyond

In the digital Justice League Beyond comics taking place in the 
Animated Universe's future (based on the Batman Beyond TV series), Mary
, Billy Batson, the wizard Shazam, and Black Adam are somehow
sharing the same body. Only one of them can exist in the real world at a
time, but can switch places with each other. She appears to be attracted
to the Green Lantern of that time period. It is unknown how this
occurred.

Tangent Comics

In the Tangent Comics print, Mary was one of three superheroines (the
others being Madame Xanadu and Lori Lemaris) who masqueraded as a heroic
version of The Joker.


In other media
