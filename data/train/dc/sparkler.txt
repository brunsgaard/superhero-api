Fictional character biography

Sparkler is a young Hispanic-American child who idolizes Major Victory
(William Vickers). He joined the Force of July to work with his hero,
and hopes to one day be just like him.

Sparkler appears in the 1987 Outsiders special. A combined team of
Infinity Inc. and Outsiders heroes breach the Force of July's compound,
an estate owned by their leader Abraham Lincoln Carlyle. In battle,
Sparkler defeats the young Windfall by burning up the air around her.


Sparkler dies in the Force of July's confrontation against the Suicide
Squad during the "Janus Directive" storyline, as seen in Suicide Squad
#27 (May 1989). This attack is brought on by Amanda Waller's need to
prove that she has been replaced by a duplicate. While pursuing Dr.
Light, Sparkler's young age and childish appearance triggers memories of
Dr. Light's past traumatic experiences with the Teen Titans, causing him
to unleash a devastating attack on Sparkler, killing him instantly.
Also, Carlyle and Mayflower die in the Squad's attack. 

Sparkler has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the
Hall of Justice.

wake while in the air.
