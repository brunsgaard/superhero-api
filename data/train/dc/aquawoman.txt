AQUAWOMAN is Earth 2's female counterpart to Aquaman, the alias of a
former queen of Atlantis named Marella introduced in the Earth 2
ongoing series. Marella was created by Tom Taylor and Nicola Scott.


Fictional character biography

Marella was queen of Atlantis and at some point of time was captured and
kept as a prisoner of the World Army, and was held in stasis in the
Black Basement of the Arkham Command Center. Marella dislikes being
called "Aquawoman", even though Jimmy Olsen would constantly call her
that. She was freed by Batman and recruited in the war against the
followers of Darkseid.  She assisted Batman and the other heroes in
locating the Kryptonian Val-Zod before returning to Atlantis but vowed
to help when called. 


Other versions

-   Lorena Marquez eventually becomes Aquawoman in the Titans
    Tomorrow future.
-   In the gender-swapped universe Earth-11, Aquawoman is the alias of
