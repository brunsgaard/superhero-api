FLODO SPAN is a gaseous member of the Green Lantern Corps. He has no
corporeal body, and holds himself together with his ring. He was a
friend of Hal Jordan's, and a member of the Green Lantern Corps of the
Kylminade.


Sentient Sector 3600

When Sinestro allied himself with the Sentient Sector 3600 to defeat the
Green Lantern Corps of Earth (Hal Jordan, Arisia, John Stewart, Katma
Tui, Kilowog, Ch'p and Salaak), Hal called in the Green Lantern Corps of
the Kylminade to help them defeat Sinestro. Ultimately, it was Flodo
Span who defeated Sector 3600 by using his ring to expand himself over
the entire sector. The effort nearly drove him insane until he used his
ring to re-gather himself back to normal size, after reducing Sector
3600 to the size of a baseball. With Sector 3600 gone, Sinestro was
quickly defeated and taken to Oa for trial and sentencing.


Power battery implosion

Flodo's most notable activity in the comics is when he assists Hal
Jordan in traveling through the dimensional barrier to speak with the
Guardians of the Universe, after the execution of Sinestro triggered the
implosion of the Central Power Battery on Oa, and the subsequent
absorption of the Green Lanterns' rings. Flodo and Hal made it through
to the Guardians, but in the process, Flodo's ring was absorbed by the
Central Battery and his gaseous form dissipated.


Blackest Night

Flodo is one of the many fallen Lanterns to be risen from his grave on
Oa to become a Black Lantern. He is one of the many Black Lanterns
beginning a stand against the living Green Lanterns on Oa.


Oath

Flodo has his own oath in the comics:
