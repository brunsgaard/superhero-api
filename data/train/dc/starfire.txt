Publication history

The design of the character (Koriand'r) incorporated aspects of many
existing characters. Artist George Pérez, in explaining the creation of
the character, stated:


Fictional character biography

Koriand'r, Starfire's given name, is a princess of the fictional planet
Tamaran in the Vegan system, and was in line to rule the planet as
Queen. Komand'r ("commander", also known as Blackfire), her older
sister, developed a bitter rivalry with her after suffering a disease in
infancy that robbed her of the ability to harness solar energy to allow
her to fly, and by extension, her right to the throne. This rivalry
continued and intensified when the siblings were sent for warrior
training with the Warlords of Okaara. Things came to a head during a
sparring exercise in which Komand'r attempted to kill her sister. As a
result, Komand'r was expelled and she swore vengeance.

That revenge came in a plot where Komand'r betrayed her planet by
supplying detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to their
enemies, the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the
surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r, who was
never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would
devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. To Kory's horror, she
learned that Komand'r was her master; Koriand'r's older sister made the
most of her sibling's years of horrific servitude. When Koriand'r killed
one of her captors, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but
the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions, a group of
sadistic alien scientists. While performing deadly experiments on the
sisters, the Psion were attacked by Komand'r's forces. Koriand'r broke
free using her starbolts, destructive blasts of solar energy which were
a result of the experimentation. She freed Komand'r, who was still
absorbing energy. Far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister with the
same, but more intense, power, and had her restrained for later
execution.

Koriand'r escaped by stealing a spacecraft to flee to the nearest
planet, Earth, where she met the first Robin and his compatriots; she
joined them in forming the Teen Titans. She became a charter member of
this team and remained a member for years, finding work as a
professional model using the name Kory Anders.

Marriages and similar relationships

While a member of the Teen Titans, Koriand'r was frequently romantically
involved with Robin (Dick Grayson). She has been married twice, both
times to Tamaranean men: once to the Prince Karras to seal a peace
treaty; and once to General Phy'zzon out of love. Karras died in battle,
while Phy'zzon died trying to defend new Tamaran against the Sun Eater.

In between these, she nearly married Dick Grayson, but their wedding was
interrupted by Raven (who was evil at the time). Raven murdered the
priest before he could pronounce Dick and Koriand'r husband and wife.
The relationship was already on unsteady ground, with Koriand'r fearing
that Dick was rushing into marriage and also concerned about the
anti-alien sentiments that sprang up in response to the news of the
impending nuptials.

In the Titans of Tomorrow storyline, Batwoman said that Starfire would
have a wonderful future with Nightwing. The half-blood Mar'i Grayson was
born from their union in the Kingdom Come timeline. However, during
Infinite Crisis, an image from the Titans Tomorrow timeline shows a
gravestone implied to belong to a deceased Dick Grayson.

Infinite Crisis

During Infinite Crisis, Starfire joined Donna's New Cronus Team that
went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the
Rann-Thanagar War. They arrived at the reset center of the universe
and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of Alexander
Luthor, who was attempting to recreate the multiverse and build a
perfect Earth from it. She is reported missing at the end of the crisis.

52

On the seventh day of the fifth week of 52, Starfire is shown to be
stranded on a paradise-like planet with Animal Man and Adam Strange. In
the same issue, it was revealed that energy ripples caused by Alexander
Luthor, Jr., altered the Zeta Ray Beams the space heroes were going to
use to return home; among other things, it caused the trio to be
teleported together to the planet.

A week and some time later, Starfire is seen eating an odd narcotic
native fruit. Luckily, Adam's tough love seems to snap her out of it, or
at least make her stop eating the fruit. Two days later, Devilance, a
being whose presence Buddy had sensed earlier, appears to Starfire. A
week, two days, and two nights later, Adam and Buddy go looking for her.
Unfortunately, they find her caught in a large net, hanging from above.
Just as Buddy realizes it is a trap, he and Adam get caught in a similar
net, with Devilance staring at them. Three days and two nights later,
Starfire awakens and works together with her comrades to distract
Devilance. She pays Devilance back for capturing her by stealing his
staff and striking him with it before catching up with Buddy and Adam.
As the trio head back to the ship, hoping to use the staff as a power
source, Devilance broods, bound by the same vines he had used to
restrain his captives.

At the end of week 16, the repairs on the ship are completed and the
trio take off for Earth. Devilance later suddenly attacks the ship and
takes back his lance. Just as Devilance is about to destroy the ship, he
is torn apart by Lobo. Believing he is going to attack them next,
Starfire convinces Lobo to help the trio by offering payment, but not
before he rips her top off. She returns to the ship to explain the
situation to her companions while Lobo hitches the ship to his space
bike. They follow Lobo in his new stronghold in Sector 3500, a sector of
space mysteriously ravaged, and ruled by Lobo acting as religious man.
To save him, and the inhabitants, from a swarm of strange creatures,
Starfire is forced to use the Emerald Eye of Ekron, alerting Ekron
himself. The ragtag team is then forced to flee, with Lobo acting as
their guide, gaining Ekron's help and discovering their real enemy, Lady
Styx, bringing havoc and mayhem in the entire Galaxy. Starfire agrees to
fight her, and she is brought as a prisoner of the galactic villainess
by Lobo, in an attempt to foil her defences. The attempt succeeds, but
Buddy is seemingly killed, and Lobo leaves.

Starfire and Adam are left alone in space, their ship slowly breaking
apart, still pursued by angry Lady Styx followers. Starfire is badly
injured, and a blind Adam Strange, who is reliant on machinery which is
no longer useful, cannot do anything to help her. Just as they are going
to crash into a sun, however, Mogo and a rookie Green Lantern come to
their rescue. Cured, but still recovering, she travels to Earth in order
to return Buddy's jacket back to his wife Ellen, unaware that Buddy was
resurrected and arrived on Earth shortly before her. Upon her return,
she manages to destroy two of Lady Styx's followers who were attacking
Buddy and his wife. She then returns Buddy's jacket to his wife, before
passing out from exhaustion and is left in the care of the Baker Family.

Countdown to Adventure

Starfire, Adam Strange, and Animal Man are fated to join forces again in
the coming Countdown to Adventure eight-issue miniseries. In issue
one of the series, Starfire discovers her powers have gone but decides
to make an attempt at a normal life. Buddy invites her to stay with the
family as an after-school sitter despite Ellen's discomfort with how
close Buddy and Starfire seem. This worsens when Buddy's son attacks
Kory whilst under the effects of Lady Styx's virus. Animal Man's
decision to follow Starfire rather than watch over his son in the
hospital leads Ellen to ask if he is in love with her, to which Buddy
does not reply. Despite the loss of her powers, Starfire demonstrates
her combat abilities as she and Animal Man fight off crowds of people
infected by the virus.

They are later trapped in San Diego with the infectees where they are
joined by the Teen Titans who are trying to break through a force field
to get to the Healers ship. After Buddy is captured, Ellen joins
Starfire to save Animal Man from dissection. They are then interrupted
by more victims of the Lady Styx virus. Alanna and Adam Strange arrive
at the scene via the Zeta Beam and meet up with Starfire and Ellen
Baker. They then save Buddy and teleport with the aid of the Zeta Beam
to Rann to restore Starfire's powers. After being teleported to Rann,
Starfire recharges her powers and rids Rann of the Lady Styx virus.

The team finds out that the sterilization is taking place in San Diego.
Starfire uses her powers to heal the people, and is later seen leaving
the Baker household for parts unknown. Starfire, Animal Man, Ellen, and
Adam Strange are teleported by a broken Zeta Beam to Earth. Starfire
attempts to rid the disease but is soon tackled by Champ Hazard into the
ground. Adam Strange blasts Champ off Kory and she cures San Diego of
the Lady Styx virus. She then leaves the Baker's household to return to
the Titans.

Rann-Thanagar Holy War

The trio again join forces in the Rann-Thanagar Holy war. After a
meeting at Titans Tower, Adam Strange Zeta Beams Starfire and Animal Man
to Rann. Apparently the belief of Lady Styx still remained even after
the virus has been eliminated. Their plan is to use a telepath to show
the horror of Lady Styx.

Titans Together

After the apparent defeat of Lady Styx, Starfire once again returned to
Animal Man's home. One afternoon, she and Animal Man's son were attacked
by a water demon in Buddy's swimming pool. Meanwhile, her old Titan
teammates had also been attacked by assorted demonic entities. This led
to Starfire, Nightwing, Troia, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Raven, Kid Flash, and
Red Arrow, to reassemble as a team, when they realized that the attacks
are the result of a resurrected Trigon and his newly discovered three
sons. While investigating, the Titans began to experience unexplained
mood-shifts. Starfire and Nightwing were overwhelmed by lust, and ended
up having abrupt sex in the middle of their investigation.

Soon after, the team met up in New York's Central Park, where they
attempted to recover from these mood-shifts and realize that each shift
coincided with one of the seven deadly sins. The team was then
approached by the Sons of Trigon. They battled the villainous prodigy,
and drove them away. Starfire and Nightwing then discuss their actions
while under the influence of Trigon's sons. While Nightwing shows hints
at wanting to renew their relationship, Starfire questions his
commitment to the relationship and goes so far as to ask Nightwing
whether or not he truly still loves her. Nightwing to his own surprise
and reluctance admits he does not, leading to them for now leaving their
reunion in doubt.

Most recently, she has been captured and turned into a Justifier, as
seen in Final Crisis: Resist. She has since been freed, although the
loss of control she gathered from the Justifier helmet distressed her
severely. She was more than happy to destroy a warehouse full of them
when Mister Terrific offered her and Cyborg to destroy them.

Blackest Night

During Hero's Day, a time when the heroes of the  Universe join
together in remembrance of dead comrades, Starfire and the Titans were
attacked by Black Lantern versions of their fallen teammates. During the
battle, Starfire and Cyborg were subjected to a psychic attack by the
Black Lantern Omen, putting them both in a euphoric state as they
experienced their greatest desires (for Starfire, marrying Dick
Grayson). Both she and Cyborg were rescued by Beast Boy.

Justice League & R.E.B.E.L.S.

Following the dissolution of the current JLA after Blackest Night,
Starfire is invited by Donna to join Kimiyo Hoshi's new Justice
League. After a short time with the team, Starfire quit the team and
left a note to Dick explaining why. She then returns to where Tamaran
used to be, to find that it had mysteriously returned. It is REVEAL that
Vril Dox of Legion has moved the planet Rann where Tamaran used to be.
Starfire agrees to join Legion and enters into a relationship with
Captain Comet. Soon Tamaranean refugees, led by Blackfire, attack Rann
believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to
it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start
of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the
fighting without bloodshed on either side. The tension between the
Rannians and the Tamaraneans was resolved by allowing the Tamaraneans to
live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent. Although her relationship
with Comet was only physical for her, Comet thought different thus
ending their relationship. She also assisted the Green Lantern Corp in
battling Psions. Starfire helped create an alliance between Rannians,
Tamaraneans and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror,
ensuring security for Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy.

Red Hood and the Outlaws

[Starfire in The New 52: Red Hood and the Outlaws #1] In 2011, 
Comics cancelled all of their monthly titles and rebooted the 
Universe continuity with 52 new titles in an initiative dubbed The New
52. As part of the relaunch, Starfire became the cast member of the
series Red Hood and the Outlaws. In the new continuity, the character
appears to have a similar origin, though she is now a member of that
titular group, in which Jason Todd (Red Hood) and Roy Harper (Arsenal)
are her teammates. As in the previous continuity, she has a past
relationship with Dick Grayson. One significant change to her backstory
is that she was sold into slavery by her sister to save Tamaran from
the Citadel. Another is that her ship, which crashed on a tropical
island, appears to be her primary home, where she keeps a number of
articles of Dick Grayson's clothing - which eventually serve to become
part of Jason's "Red Hood" uniform.

Aliens of all sorts, but especially Tamaraneans, are hunted after on
Earth as a man called Crux finds a picture of her, then attacks her and
attempts to drain her powers away. After she is attacked by Crux,
it is revealed she was experimented on to some measure by The Citadel,
which allowed her to retain her power through unconventional means after
being hit with technology designed to drain her powers.

Starfire, at first, seemingly no longer remembers the Teen Titans when
asked about them. However, it's later shown that she does retain her
memories and recalls Dick Grayson and Roy's full name. Her sexual
desires are brought up very casually when she offhandedly offers Harper
a chance to sleep with her. Kori tells Jason and Roy that Tamaraneans
are said to have a short attention span when it comes to "all things
Earth", seeing humans as little more than sensory experiences.
Later, it is shown that Koriand'r lied about her species'
characteristics for personal reasons, and that her race in fact
processes romantic feelings very deeply.

In a flashback, Jason reveals that Koriand'r is the one who found him
and nursed him back to health on the island she has made her home (after
her ship crashed on it). The two attempted a romantic relationship, but
Jason later notes that "[they] just friend-zoned each other". However,
he considers her a dear friend, and narrates that if he ever gets used
to Koriand'r kissing him, to shoot him.

It's soon revealed that Koriand'r is Commander of a Spaceship named
Starfire, the crew consisting of slaves she helped free when she
herself escaped slavery. The Starfire has returned to earth for Kori
because that Tamaran has been taken over by The Blight, a parasitic
alien race. Starfire talks to Roy and Jason in private and explains
that she and Komand'r, her sister, were always not on the best of terms,
though they tried. This is mainly because Kori blames her sister and the
people of Tamaran for her enslavement, so she is torn on if she should
help them now. Roy is then kidnapped during an attack on the ship and
taken to Tamaran, driving Star to go to her home planet. Eventually,
Starfire decides she cannot leave her people and her sister helpless, so
after they rescue Roy, the Outlaws and the crew of the Starfire help
Blackfire take back Tamaran, and Kori reconciles with her sister.

Later on, Kori's memories are forcefully returned, which leads Roy
Harper to discover that she lied about her nonchalance towards
relationships. Roy breaks up with her because of his own trust issues
(particularly towards Oliver Queen), but the two reconcile later on,
resulting in a much more tender relationship, since Kori is able to be
emotive as she normally is, and no longer has to hide her emotions. Roy
openly admits to Jason several times that he loves her, and later on,
the pair confess their love to one another.

Right at the end of the series, Tamaran is invaded again by Helspont,
and, to ensure the safety of her people, Blackfire sides with him on the
condition that Tamaran be spared. Koriand'r is devastated, but
eventually, however, Blackfire hears her sister's pleas and betrays
Helspont, destroying him and nearly killing herself in the process.

This leads Kori and Roy to break up - though purely out of necessity -
as Koriand'r is forced to return to Tamaran, so that Blackfire can get
the medical attention she needs. The two share a kiss, and Koriand'r
promises to remember Roy for "forever and a day". After Starfire
departs, Roy announces to Jason that he, too, will now go his separate
way, too, thus leaving Jason on his own. Rose Wilson, who was hired to
kill Koriand'r (but eventually decided not to when she realised she was
hired by Helspont), asks if Jason needs a minute after losing his team.
He replies that they were not a team, they were friends.

Starfire

In 2015, Koriand'r was given a new solo on going series titled
Starfire, wherein she returns to Earth (presumably by this point her
sister is healed) - specifically, to Key West, a small coastal town. She
befriends the local Sheriff, Stella Gomez, and a super-powered woman
whose civilization lives inside the Earth's surface, called Atlee. As of
issue #5, she has also befriended Stella's widowed brother, Sol (who
bears a striking resemblance to Dick Grayson), and appears to not be
particularly interested in heroism. Roy Harper has been revealed to be
making an appearance, and Dick Grayson has been featured prominently on
the covers of the as-of-yet unreleased issues #7 and #8 - the latter of
which the pair are depicted kissing.


Powers and abilities

Starfire is a Tamaranean and as such her physiology is designed to
constantly absorb ultraviolet radiation. The radiation is then converted
to pure energy, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds. Originally,
Starfire was capable of using this power to fly in space. However, it is
established in Red Hood and the Outlaws #2 and #27 that the rebooted
Starfire is unable to fly without the effects of gravity, leaving her
unable to travel in space unaided. This energy also gives her incredible
superhuman strength and durability. This strength, combined with her
fighting skills, allowed her to defeat the much stronger Donna Troy
about two out of three times during purely hand to hand matches. She
later proved strong enough to fight against Wonder Woman for a short
period of time and, during a fit of rage, was so strong that Donna Troy
was unable to restrain her without the help of Mon-El. After being
experimented on by the alien Psions, Starfire gained the ability to
release her absorbed energy into incredibly powerful green-colored
blasts called "starbolts." As shown in the "Insiders" crossover story
arc (Teen Titans and Outsiders), Starfire can also release nearly
all of her stored energy as a powerful omni-directional explosive burst,
many times stronger and more powerful than her standard blasts. The
released energy leaves her in a weakened state. Starfire also
demonstrated more control over her powers in the New 52 reboot, having
used her internal energy to melt the metal of Jason Todd's gun when it
came into contact with her skin. Starfire, and all Tamaraneans, are
capable of assimilating languages through physical contact with another
person. When Starfire attempts to do so with a male, she typically does
so by kissing because it is "more fun" for her. Starfire is also
proficient in hand-to-hand combat, having been trained by the Warlords
of Okaara.

-   In Amalgam Comics, Starfire (Kory) was combined with Shatterstar
    from  to create Shatterstarfire.
-   In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Starfire joins
    with the Amazons' Furies. She intends to burn the city to the
    ground. Starfire then goes after circus members Dick Grayson and

    Amazons with her are killed in a gasoline explosion caused by
    Dick.
-   In Kingdom Come universe, Starfire married Dick and they had a
    daughter named Mar'i Grayson. She eventually died which put a strain
    on Dick and Mar'i's relationship. Mar'i was inspired by her parents
    to become the superheroine Nightstar.
-   In the comic tie-in to Injustice: Gods Among Us, Starfire and the
    Titans are devastated when the nuclear explosion caused by the Joker
    kills Beast Boy and Kid Flash. She still harbors a romantic interest
    for Dick Grayson (who recently left the team to join the
    Justice League) in this reality. Despite Dick's warnings, she and
    the other Titans arrive at the Fortress of Solitude to help Superboy
    stop Superman. Superman mortally wounds Superboy and sends the rest
    of the Titans into the Phantom Zone to not only save Conner's life,
    but to also make sure they don't interfere with his plans.
-   In Teen Titans Go!_ #46 (a comic book spin-off from the TV series),
    it is revealed that Starfire has a younger brother named Wildfire.
    When the Gordanians had attacked Tamaran, her parents set up a ship
    to save him by launching him to another planet, thus saving the
    Tamaranean royal family bloodline. Afterwards, Blackfire, in an
    attempt to make a treaty between the Tamaranians and Gordanians,
    gives them Starfire as a slave (setting up her appearance in the
    episode "Go!"). As a result of Starfire and Wildfire's absence,
    their parents had tragically died of a broken heart. Wildfire
    seemingly comes to Earth to meet up with his second eldest sister,
    but he is revealed to be the shapeshifting Madame Rouge, who was
    aided in the deception by Blackfire. Discovering this, a furious and
    heartbroken Starfire closes off all sisterly ties with Blackfire
    (stating that they are no longer sisters), and vows that she will
    find her long-lost younger brother, as he is the only family she
    has left.


In other media

Television

[Starfire in the original Teen Titans animated series (2003-2006)]

-   Starfire appears in the Teen Titans animated series, voiced by
    Hynden Walch. In this version, she misuses idioms and doesn't use
    contractions in her speech.
-   Starfire appears in the New Teen Titans shorts, with Hynden Walch
    reprising her role. In one short, she kisses a Spanish boy to learn
    Spanish, just like how she kissed a Japanese boy to learn Japanese
    in Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. This causes Robin to be jealous
    and learn French to impress her. When he shows her his amazing
    French skills, she kisses him on the lips.
-   Starfire appears in Teen Titans Go!_, with Hynden Walch reprising
    her role. However, unlike her previous incarnation in the 2003
    series, Starfire does not reciprocate Robin's romantic feelings
    towards her. Rather, she sees him as a younger brother figure
    or friend. However, in "Mouth Hole" and "The Return of Slade" it is
    predicted that they kissed. In this version, Starfire is shown
    getting angrier more often. Her rage and fury releases a huge
    barrage of unusually strong and destructive bright green starbolt
    energy blasts that cause quite a lot of damage and pain to
    her enemies. That and she is much less mature.

Film

-   Starfire appears in the Teen Titans animated series adaptation
    film Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo, with Hynden Walch reprising

    Superman punches her. Her appearance in this film is much like her
    comic counterpart.
-   Starfire has a very brief cameo in Batman vs. Robin appearing as a
    still image on Dick Grayson's phone, although the image is obscured
    due to an incoming call notification from Alfred. Kory calls Dick

    discovering Damian escaped and Batman needed help. Her voice is
    never heard.
-   Starfire makes another cameo in Batman: Bad Blood, this time
    voiced by Kari Wahlgren. She and Dick had plans for a date at Titans
    Tower but it was cancelled by Dick after a fight with Blockbuster

    is once again obscured by an incoming call notification from Alfred,
    although more of the picture can be seen this time; she can be
    confirmed to have solid green eyes and red hair.
-   Starfire appears in the animated film Justice League vs. Teen

Other Starfires

Red Star

The first  character to use the name Starfire was Leonid Kovar,
a Russian national that first appeared in Teen Titans #18 (December
1968). After his second appearance (New Teen Titans #18, April 1982)
he changed his name to "Red Star" in acknowledgment of Koriand'r's
appropriation of the name.

Starfire

The second  character to use the name Starfire was a foe of
Supergirl, who first appeared in Adventure Comics #402 (February
1971). She created a pill that frequently negated Supergirl's powers for
several months, causing the Girl of Steel to wear an exo-skeleton that
simulated many of her normal abilities. She has not been seen
post-Crisis.

Sornaii Champion

The third  character to use the name Starfire was a dark haired
woman. The character's series first appeared in 1976, running for 8
issues and took place on a strange alien world called Pytharia.
