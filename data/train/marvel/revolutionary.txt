Fictional character biography

The Revolutionary is a member of the Liberteens, a superhero team based
in Philadelphia who are the official government-approved superteam for
the state of Pennsylvania. He is initially portrayed as the level-headed
and respectful leader of the group; he doesn't participate in the hidden
debauchery which his team commits when not in public, and shuns them for
it. During the Secret Invasion storyline, it is revealed that he is in
fact a Skrull secret agent, sent as part of a Skrull plan to conquer the
Earth. It is unknown how long the Revolutionary had been replaced. The
Revolutionary was shown to be in contact with Criti Noll, the Skrull
posing as Yellowjacket, speaking from Camp Hammond.

When 3D-Man began his cross country effort with the Skrull Kill Krew to
rid the Initiative of Skrull infiltrators, the Revolutionary is one of
the Skrulls defeated. Gravity drops the diamond-skinned Hope on top of
the Revolutionary and dramatically amplifies her mass, crushing him to a
bloody pulp.

The real Revolutionary appears among the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and heroes
that were replaced, attending a support group meeting. He doesn't take
part in the clash against the Thor clone called Ragnarok.
