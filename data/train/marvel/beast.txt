Beast}}

BEAST (HENRY PHILIP "HANK" MCCOY) is a fictional superhero appearing in
American comic books published by  and is a founding member
of the X-Men. Originally called "The Beast", the character was
introduced as a mutant possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength
and agility, oversize hands and feet, a genius-level intellect, and an
otherwise normal appearance. Eventually being referred to simply as
"Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive physiological transformations,
permanently gaining animalistic physical characteristics. These include
blue fur, both simian and feline facial features, pointed ears, fangs,
and claws. Beast's physical strength and senses increased to even
greater levels.

Despite Hank McCoy's inhuman appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant,
well-educated man in the arts and sciences, known for his witty sense of
humor. He is a world authority on biochemistry and genetics, the X-Men's
medical doctor, and the science and mathematics instructor at the Xavier
Institute (the X-Men's headquarters and school for young mutants). He is
also a mutant political activist, campaigning against society's bigotry
and discrimination against mutants. While fighting his own bestial
instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his physical
and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.

One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related
comics since his debut. He has also been a member of the Avengers and
Defenders.

The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated
TV series and feature films. In X2, Steve Bacic portrayed him in a
very brief cameo in his human appearance, while in X-Men: The Last
Stand he was played by Kelsey Grammer. Nicholas Hoult portrays a
younger version of the character in X-Men: First Class. Both Hoult and
Grammer reprise their roles in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Hoult is
set to reprise the role in the upcoming 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.


Publication history

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the
character first appeared in X-Men #1 (September 1963). Stan Lee writes
in the foreword to X-Men: The Ultimate Guide that he made Beast the
most articulate, eloquent, and well-read of the X-Men to contrast with
his brutish exterior. Further, the book opines that the Werner Roth-Roy
Thomas team garnered admiration for their "appealing and sensitive
characterizations of the original X-Men." Roth, under the alias Jay
Gavin, had taken over for Kirby fully by issue #18, and Thomas was a new
talent. Beast was given an individualized, colorful new costume, along
with the rest of the X-Men by issue #39 in order to attract new readers.
Jim Steranko's tenure, which added "exciting art", Roth returned,
working with Neal Adams who blended Kirby's style with "realism,
idealized beauty, and epic grandeur."

In Amazing Adventures #11 (March 1972), written by Gerry Conway, Beast
underwent a radical change and mutated into his now familiar furry, blue
appearance. The concept originated with Roy Thomas, an effort to make
the character more visibly striking, and Beast also became more
werewolf-like to capitalize on the success of Werewolf by Night. Over
the next decade he would appear on the roster of several teams in titles
ranging from Avengers to Defenders to X-Factor. It wasn't until
1991, in X-Factor #70/X-Men #1, that the Beast finally returned to
the X-Men.

Beast cured the Legacy Virus in Uncanny X-Men #390 (2001), and in
X-Treme X-Men #3 (2001) he experienced a further mutation into a
feline being, first shown in the introduction to New X-Men (June,
2001), by Frank Quitely and Grant Morrison. As evidenced on the back
cover of X-Treme X-Men Vol. 1, Chris Claremont, writer of that series
in addition to both Uncanny X-Men (for sixteen consecutive years) and
X-Factor, contributed much to the Beast's characterization. Citing
Claremont as inspiration for his run on New X-Men, Morrison explains
Beast as a "brilliant, witty bipolar scientist." Morrison continues, "I
saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever, witty, cultured, well-traveled,
experienced, well-read character so I brought out those parts of his
personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and
most worldly people I know â€“ his sense of humor is dark and oblique.
He's obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement
and ghastly self-doubt. He has no dark secrets, however, and nothing to
hide."

Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men: Gifted story arc featured a "mutant
cure" designed by Indian Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, and the
prospect of "real" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated
Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of
illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim. The idea of a mutant
cure, which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series, was
also the basis of the X-Men: The Last Stand movie plot and the series
was even made into a motion comic. IGN called the arc focusing on Beast
"best X-Men run in a decade" and lauded Whedon for flawless character
dynamics. According to BusinessWeek, Beast is listed as one of the
top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.

Beast appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 Secret
Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37
(March 2013).


Fictional character biography

HENRY PHILIP "HANK" MCCOY was born in Dundee, Illinois, in the United
States, to Norton and Edna McCoy. His father, Norton McCoy, is employed
at a local nuclear power plant before Henry's birth and was once exposed
to intense nuclear radiation, which appears to have caused his son's
mutation. Hank is born with a vast intellect, unusually long arms and
legs, and unusually large hands and feet for a human; in fact, his
body's proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla and later
stories reveal his nickname in school was "Magilla Gorilla".

With the X-Men

[Detail of cover to The X-Men vol. 1 #8 (Nov. 1964).
Art by Jack Kirby.] Henry's mutation more fully manifests during
adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his
powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time
at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and
other non-mutant humans. As he seeks refuge, he is approached by
Professor Charles Xavier, who invites him to study at Xavier's School
for Gifted Youngsters.

Henry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and
accepts the invitation. He finds the school both a fountain of
scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary. There he is introduced to
the X-Men, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename
Beast. Alongside workouts in the Danger Room, under Xavier's tutelage,
he studies subjects ranging from differential equations to Proust.

With the rest of the X-Men on their first field mission, he battles
Magneto for the first time, and later Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil
Mutants. He became stressed because he had to keep a secret identity
while in the X-Men team, so he briefly left the team to become a
professional wrestler. While he was a professional wrestler he met Unus
the Untouchable and helped him build a ray gun to make Unus completely
invincible. Beast then rejoined the X-Men team. With the team, he
also visits the Savage Land, and meets Ka-Zar. Hank even battles the
Juggernaut but is badly hurt. He then fights the Sentinels with the
X-Men. In addition, he and Iceman fight the Maha Yogi. Hank later
recounts his clash with the Conquistador and how he joined the
X-Men.

Furry change and team trading

Hank leaves the X-Men shortly after his twentieth birthday, after
remarking that he is no longer one of the "strangest teens of all." He
becomes a research scientist at the Brand Corporation, a genetics
research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, quickly becomes his
girlfriend. Hank isolates a "hormonal extract" allowing anyone to become
a mutant for a short period of time, and uses the mutagenic serum on
himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his
research. He waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him
permanently transformed. He grows grey fur, which later turns blue, all
over his body and acquires pointed ears, elongated canine teeth, claws,
the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses,
an accelerated healing factor, and a feral side he struggles to control.
He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when Mastermind wipes
out his memory, but quickly recovers. When Beast is wounded, he is aided
by Patsy Walker, and then reunited with his old girlfriend, Vera
Cantor. Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend
Linda Donaldson is an agent of the criminal Secret Empire, and they
break up.

[Detail of cover of X-Men vol. 2 #1 (1991). Art by Jim Lee.] Not long
after this transformation, Beast is recruited to join the Avengers as a
provisional member. He is later granted full Avengers membership
and remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of Wonder
Man. He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X-Men during times of
need (such as The Dark Phoenix Saga). Beast returns to the
Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team, which has a
six-member limit at the time, can be filled out by new recruits.

He later joins the Defenders, stays with the team to organize as the
"new" Defenders, and is one of the final surviving members at the
time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with Moondragon
and the Dragon of the Moon. Beast and fellow surviving Defenders
Angel and Iceman are contacted shortly after by Cyclops and Jean Grey to
form a new group, X-Factor.

With X-Factor, Beast rejoins the original members of the X-Men, and is
again reunited with Vera Cantor. Beast starts out in his furred form,
but on their second mission, he is captured by Tower. He is delivered to
Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy,
which has rendered Maddicks' son, Artie, mute. Maddicks develops a serum
based on McCoy's original serum, and tests it on Beast. Hank is also
subjected to chemotherapy and radiation, and suffers a cardiac arrest.
X-Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank, but not before he's been
injected with the serum. When the bandages around his face are removed,
he is revealed to have lost his blue fur. This helps in X-Factor's
cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire (though they
actually help the mutants they capture). When they see the need for
their powers, they don new costumes similar to their old X-Men costumes,
and call themselves the X-Terminators, posing as renegade mutants. Beast
wears a mask as he did originally, since he now looks human again.

Eventually X-Factor clashes with the ancient mutant Apocalypse after
Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing.
Apocalypse turns Angel into Death, the most powerful of his four
Horsemen of Apocalypse. During the battle, Beast is touched by the
Horseman Pestilence, whose touch usually causes incredible pain and
viral infection. The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment
of Maddicks, and instead of killing him, Hank is affected in such a way
that every time he uses his superhuman strength, his intelligence
decreases. Though the battle is won, it comes at the cost of Hank's
decreasing intelligence and Angel's humanity, which would not return for
a time. Hankâ€™s condition worsens for weeks. He even openly talks to
Trish Tilby, a reporter, not realizing she might use the information on
TV. Out of respect for Hank's situation, Trish does not mention his name
when she reports about X-Factorâ€™s recent battles, only that one of them
lost his intellect while heroically defending New York. Beast is still
hurt by her using the information at all, but she is able to convince
him that she meant well.

X-Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes, and they
then don costumes similar to their previous X-Terminator costumes. When
Hankâ€™s mind is nothing more than that of a child, he intercepts a mutant
called Infectia who is trying to kiss Iceman. Infectia has the ability
to manipulate molecular structures through touch, creating mutated
"monsters". When she kisses Beast, he becomes feverish and begins
switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms.
Finally, he stabilizes in his furry appearance, keeps his intelligence,
and has more strength than ever.

Hank soon resumes wearing his old costume, but now no longer has need
for a mask. During the events of Inferno, Beast, along with the rest
of X-Factor team up with the X-Men and various other heroes to fight the
evil forces invading the city; eventually, they manage to stop a portal
between Limbo and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the
survivors. Soon after Inferno ends, the X-Tinction Agenda takes
place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on
their island. Here, Beast plays yet another key role. Shortly after the
crisis ends, X-Factor switches costumes once more; Cyclops, Jean, and
Iceman all wear identical costumes, while Beast returns to wearing
trunks, and Archangel sticks to his old costume he received from
Apocalypse.

Towards the end of X-Factor's career, they battle the Shadow King during
the Muir Island Saga. The final battle leaves Professor Xavier
crippled again, which results in X-Factor rejoining the X-Men.

1990s: Legacy Virus

One of Beast's greatest challenges emerges with Stryfe's fatal Legacy
Virus. Hank is already despondent, as he is turning thirty and questions
his life accomplishments. His frustrations are further compounded when
Professor Xavier and Moira MacTaggert don't ask for his assistance with
the Legacy research, but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his
privacy. Perusing their data, Hank learns the problem is more difficult
than he had initially imagined. Hank has always believed that, given
time, he could solve any problem; the Legacy Virus becomes his
obsession. He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving
Mister Sinister information on the virus, since he has more resources
and fewer morals to inhibit him.

A turning point comes when Dark Beast finishes some of the formula,
occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisoned and
replaces for a while. The most critical step toward a solution
(other than when Beast individually finds the cure without
acknowledgement) comes when Dr. MacTaggert discovers Mystique's
irresponsible manipulation of virus strains. The cure is incomplete and
it takes Beast to design the final cure. Based on Moira's notes, Beast
concocts the anti-virus to much elation, but it soon is repaid with a
heavy tollâ€”Colossus chooses to sacrifice his life to release the
remedy.

After mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school
with Storm and her X-Treme X-Men team in search of Destiny's diaries.
After an attack by Vargas that leaves Psylocke dead, Beast is gravely
injured and returns to the Institute.

2000s: Enhanced feline form

As the world experiences a mutant baby boom, much of the mutant
community seemingly begins experiencing "secondary mutations", often
taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of
Vargas' attack, Beast's secondary mutation is "jumpstarted" due to the
powers of teammate Sage. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a
more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A
psychic attack by the genocidal Cassandra Nova leaves Beast humiliated,
badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend Beak) and haunted by
the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state
of devolution. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time
girlfriend, Trish Tilby, to break up with him after being accused of
bestiality in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up a strong friendship
with Emma Frost, in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up.
He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends
some time putting her back together. With a final jolt of psionic energy
from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.

Beast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline
features, like his situation. This raises hopes for him, until he
discovers it's not a mutant human that looks like a cat, it's a mutant
cat who looks like a human. Either way, the creature is at the limit of
her life and Beast allows her to leave the X-Mansion to pass away
quietly in a spot she finds comfortable.

[Cover art for Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #1 (July 2004), depicting
Beast's feline form.
Art by John Cassaday.] When news of a "cure" that would reverse
mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering
taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides
against it after vigorous "urging" by fellow team member Wolverine, as
it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were
to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow
geneticist Kavita Rao through experimentation on mutant corpses â€“ as
well as on the X-Man Colossus â€“ Beast helps take down Rao's operation.
When the villainous Hellfire Club attacks the X-Men, Cassandra Nova
telepathically strips away Beast's higher human consciousness, leaving
him with only his animal instincts. After hunting Wolverine around
campus (and even eating his leg), a student named Blindfold faces him
down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was
ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of
a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear.
Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine
with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, are taken
from the Mansion by the government agency S.W.O.R.D. and airlifted to
the alien Breakworld.

When a Civil War breaks out among 's superheroes, Beast, along
with the other X-Men, assumes a neutral stance. Beast was not a
particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by
providing Spider-Man with a holographic disguise to enable him to
continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been
exposed. Despite his personal feelings about the Superhuman
Registration Act, Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program
after the war's end, to assist in the training of the next generation of
superheroes.

The X-Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant
boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and
muse on what this means for mutant-kind. Beast plans to find a way to
reverse M-Day. Despite the 'aid' of his other self (the Dark Beast),
along with exploring such diverse avenues of investigation as analysis
of alternate timelines or an attempt to track down the Scarlet Witch, he
is unsuccessful in his research, but the final part shows him holding a
child wearing a three-eyed smiley face shirt saying "Evolution" on it as
a promotion of the Messiah Complex.

Beast is training with the New X-Men when the Sentinels fly off and the
Hulk shows up looking for Xavier. Beast summons several X-Men to the
fight. Beast is endangered by the Hulk when he is saved by several of
his teammates. Charles shows them what he saw and Beast is shocked and
apologizes to Hulk.

Beast is shown helping Professor X repair Cerebro when the X-Men are
tracking down the child with the X-Gene. Beast is later seen at the
Mansion when it is attacked by the Sentinels, who have been taken over
by an unknown person. When Iceman arrives at the school with the New
X-Men, Beast works with Prodigy and is able to stabilize the mortally
wounded Hellion, as well as the other New X-Men and X-Men injured in
their battles with the Purifiers and the Marauders, respectively. He
is later present during the battle on Muir Island and is among the first
to reach Professor Xavier after he is accidentally shot by Bishop.
Xavier's body soon disappears.

In the aftermath, Cyclops has sent Beast to search for Professor Xavier,
whose status is unknown by the X-Men. He is also seen closing down the
ruins of the X-Mansion and taking Martha Johansson with him.

Beast is seen as part of the team setting up a new X-Men headquarters in
San Francisco, California. He is working closely with Cyclops, Emma
Frost, and the rookie X-Man, Armor. He is also still seeing Abigail
Brand, who requests that he take a weekend off from the X-Men so that
she can 'tamper with him extensively'. He helps Tabitha Smith, teaching
the young and flippant woman to use research instead of brutal strength
to fight her enemy, a mutant with sedation powers called Nuwa. He
and Warren go to Buenos Aires to recruit Doctor Nemesis to help the
X-Men save the Mutant race. Only after they stop tube-grown super Nazis,
does Nemesis agree. They also recruit Madison Jeffries.
Together, they created a time travel device so that they could travel
into the future and retrieve the mutant Messiah. However, because they
created a device for time travel in so little time, the side-effect of
the device is that the user's biology breaks down upon entering the
future, so it will automatically bring the person back in thirty-two and
a half hours.

Beast discovers that the Super-Skrulls with X-Men abilities can be
infected with the Legacy Virus. Despite his ethical protests to the
contrary, Cyclops decides to use it on them, offering the antidote in
return for the Skrulls' retreat.

2010s

In order to save mutantkind from the effects of M-Day, Beast and Angel
had to gather a team of specialists to help them. They gathered Madison
Jeffries, Yuriko Takiguchi, and Dr. Nemesis. They then returned to
Graymalkin Industries to meet their final member Dr. Kavita Rao (who was
formerly trying to cure mutation).Beast and the X-Club traveled back to
1906 in order to find Dr. Nemesis' parents and discover the origins of
modern mutation. During the mission, they also fought an early version
of a Sentinel created by the Hellfire Club, and inadvertently caused the
San Francisco earthquake. When they returned to the present, they found
that their DNA evidence had been buried beneath where the Dreaming
Celestial was standing in the park.

After being captured, Beast became a test subject for the Omega Machine
(designed by Dark Beast to eradicate mutant powers and place them in
Weapon Omega) while being held prisoner on Alcatraz Island by Norman
Osborn, along with Professor X. Beast is shown getting weaker and
mentions losing his claws while hooked up to the machine. Beast was
rescued by the X-Men, and later recuperated from his injuries. Later, he
spoke at the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi when Magneto had arrived.
Beast seemed increasingly disillusioned with Cyclops' leadership and
methods, such as allowing Magneto to become a member to his time under
torture under the Dark Beast. This resulted in Beast leaving the
X-Men.

After leaving the X-Men, Beast opted to join his current girlfriend
Agent Abigail Brand as a member of S.W.O.R.D. However, shortly after
joining her in space, Brand's co-commander, Henry Peter Gyrich (hired by
Norman Osborn) begins to round-up the aliens residing on Earth, in a
xenophobic attempt at avoiding another Secret Invasion. As a result of
Henry's plan, he has even made moves against Brand, resulting in her,
Beast, and the dragon Lockheed, becoming fugitives from S.W.O.R.D. and
attempting to overthrow Gyrich.

Beast later returns in an issue of Uncanny X-Men to attend the funeral
of his friend and teammate, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) where he
confronts Scott Summers and blames Kurt's death on Scott's increasingly
militant and extremist attitude to protecting the mutant species at all
costs (even at the cost of sacrificing his friends to do so).
Despite his issues with Cyclops, Beast remains on Utopia to help deal
with the attacks being made by Bastion. Following Bastion's defeat at
the hands of Hope Summers, Henry again departs Utopia.

Hank appears as part of Steve Rogers' Secret Avengers team. He goes
with the covert ops squad on their mission to Mars, and assisted the
team in helping Shang Chi. He also played a crucial part in the capture,
interrogation, and "un-brainwashing" of John Steele.

2010s storylines

After the separation of the X-Men into two teams, Beast is in the team
that goes with Wolverine to open The Jean Grey School for Higher
Learning in Westchester County, New York.

[Beast as he appears in All New X-Men #10 (June 2013), depicting the
return to his simian form.
Art by Stuart Immonen.] During the Avengers vs. X-Men miniseries,
Beast sides with the Avengers to investigate and stop the Phoenix
Force's return to Earth. Hank joins the team of Avengers sent to halt
the Phoenix Force's return to Earth, but later temporarily 'resigns'
from the Avengers in protest against their efforts to stop the 'Phoenix
Five'- the five X-Men who have received the power of the Phoenix Force â€“
as their actions appear to initially be benevolent. He returns to
aid the Avengers and the X-Men when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be
corrupted by the Phoenix's power.

In the aftermath of the Phoenix War, Cyclops now actively strikes out at
government organizations and holds mutants prisoner, with the X-Men
unwilling to actively fight him as they fear the subsequent mutant civil
war that might result. Beast, who is apparently dying due to
side-effects of his secondary artificially-accelerated mutation,
stumbles upon a solution after a chance comment from Iceman. Beast
travels back in time to the early days of the Xavier Institute to bring
the original five X-Men from that period into the future, hoping that
Scott's past self will be able to convince his present self to stand
down.

Beast lapses into a coma shortly after bringing the team into the
present, and Jean's telepathy, which is artificially accelerated by
the trauma of her trip to the future and witnessing what Scott has
become, manages to connect the minds of the two Hanks. This allows
the younger Hank to spot a mistake in his future self's calculations and
stabilize his physiology by reverting to a blue furred ape-like state
again, though this time, his ape-form is bald and has no head hair aside
from the blue fur covering his whole body.

While the elder McCoy remains at the Jean Grey School, his younger self
later "defects" to Cyclops's school, after the Battle of the Atom â€“
which featured the death of a version of Beast from even further in the
future. He is later transported to the Ultimate  universe, where
he is captured by that world's version of Doctor Doom.

Following the reconstruction of reality after the Battleworld crisis,
the displaced X-Men remain in the future, travelling the world as they
try to find their place, while the 'present' Beast works with the
Inhumans to find a means of resolving the recent release of Terrigenesis
crystals that have proven dangerous to mutants. Increasingly frustrated
with his inability to find a way back to their time through science, the
young Beast contacts Doctor Strange for advice on using magic, but
although Strange cannot help due to his currently weakened powers, when
Hank is able to help him find a solution to a dimensional rift he was
investigating, Strange reassures Hank that he is smart enough to find a
solution to the current dilemma.


Powers and abilities

It is possible that Beast's mutation is a result of genetic atavism.
However, he also possesses neotenous characteristics, which may explain
him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique. He
also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an
excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic
combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier's and
coaching from Captain America.

Anthropoid/Simian physique

Originally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human
alongside a generally simian physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and
enlarged extremities) equivalent to that of a Great Ape. This mutation
gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility,
dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. Hank is equally
dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or
hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can
outperform any Olympic-level athlete, contorting his body and performing
aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb
vertical surfaces with just his hands and/or feet, jump great
distances and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person.
He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great
distances over open terrain and his feet are sensitive enough to
detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through
solid walls and floors. Later, he drank an experimental solution of
his own making and mutated further through the growth of grey fur
covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing
abilities, especially his strength, and Hank also gained a nearly
instantaneous healing factor. The psychological impact of this first
transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also
made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which
would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during
combat. However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time,
changing his fur color from grey to black (although comic book printing
technology depicted it as blue), returning his strength back to previous
levels, and losing his healing factor. He was also able to more
easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast
gained the ability to emit mood altering pheromones, causing sexual
attraction in women. During this time he was occasionally depicted with
claws and fangs, but these were not a part of his original mutation.
Hank McCoy briefly returned to his humanoid/simian form with his
hair color now being depicted as black, not reddish-brown. However, as a
result of being touched by Pestilence his strength began to increase
exponentially while his intellect began to decrease.

After Infectia's kiss restored Hank to his simian physique, his
intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius-level, and
his strength had increased to superhuman proportions. Beast's fangs
and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return
to his "blue and furry" form.

Feline physique

After being critically wounded, Hank's body undergoes a secondary
mutation, jump started by Sage. The result is a more feline appearance
equivalent to that of a big cat. His strength, speed, stamina,
sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains
cat-like agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his
senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In
addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him
to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours.
However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from
a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the
opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that
he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums
instead. Following the X-Men's relocation to San Francisco, Beast
discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. In the
first issue of Warren Ellis' Astonishing X-Men run, Beast also
comments he no longer needs full sleep.

It is later discovered that his secondary feline mutation is still
detrimental to his health: as such, with the combined efforts of past
versions of Jean Grey and himself, Beast's condition was stabilized in a
more human-like form, possessing blue fur and larger than the average
human male but otherwise fairly human.

Genius-level intellect

Hank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned biochemist,
having earned Ph.D.s in Biophysics and Genetics, and is the man who
cured the Legacy Virus. He frequently functions as both field medic and
in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having an MD.
His intelligence and expertise in genetics rival that of Professor X,
Moira McTaggert, and Kavita Rao. Despite this, he has never received a
Nobel Prize or been elected to the United States National Academy of
Sciences. A Renaissance man, McCoy is well-versed in many fields
including languages (fluent in English, German, French, Latin, Spanish,
Japanese, Arabic, and Russian as well as the fictional language
Latverian), literature, philosophy, psychology, and sociology,
history, art and art history, anthropology, linguistics, and music, as
well as in political science and economics with a special affinity for
science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics. His
vast scientific knowledge ranges from theoretical physics, quantum
mechanics, differential equations, nanotechnology, anatomy, biomedicine,
analytical chemistry, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering
to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert,
he often repairs Cerebro and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings.
He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards,
including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers.


Similarities

According to writer Will Murray, a possible inspiration for the Beast
was Andrew Blodgett "Monk" Mayfair, a companion of pulp hero Doc Savage.
Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant
scientists. Before becoming more erudite in later issues, McCoy also
used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk.

Film

-   Beast was included in early drafts for the 2000 film X-Men, but
    had to be removed for the film to be greenlit by the studio, due to
    budget concerns. Elements of his persona, including his medical
    expertise, were transferred into Jean Grey's character.
-   Steve Bacic makes a brief cameo as Dr. Hank McCoy in the 2003 film
    X2, on a television screen in a bar.
-   Kelsey Grammer portrays Beast in the 2006 film X-Men: The Last
    Stand. In the film, Beast is a member of the cabinet of the
    President of the United States, serving as Secretary of
    Mutant Affairs. After a "cure" for human mutation is developed and
    weaponized, he resigns from his position in the government and helps
    the X-Men fight Magneto's forces on Alcatraz Island. He ultimately
    injects Magneto with the cure. After the incident, he is appointed
    United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
-   Nicholas Hoult portrays a younger Beast in the 2011 prequel film
    X-Men: First Class. Actor Benjamin Walker was originally cast
    in the role, but dropped out of the film to star in the Broadway
    musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson. In the film, he
    originally possesses only prehensile feet and enhanced speed,
    agility and reflexes. He attempts to cure himself of his mutation
    with a serum derived from Mystique's DNA, but this causes his
    transformation into his blue-furred feline form
-   Hoult and Grammer returned as Beast in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of
    Future Past. Hoult revealed to Joblo that Hank created a serum
    which controls his mutation, making him appear human unless he gets
    angry. Grammer reprised his role as the older Beast in a cameo
    at the end of the film. When asked by the younger Beast if he is
    alive in the future, Wolverine tells him that he is not. A viral
    marketing website for the film shows that Beast was killed in 2015
    by an angry mob of human protesters outside his home in upstate New
    York. Wolverine's actions in the past â€“ during which he
    interacted with the younger Beast and warned him and Xavier about
    the future â€“ create a new timeline where Beast is alive, with
    Wolverine seeing the older Beast (an uncredited Kelsey Grammer)
    walking through the Xavier Mansion when he returns to the future.
-   Hoult will be reprising his role as Beast for the final time in
    X-Men: Apocalypse.

Print

In the  magazine,  Vision, for most of the series Beast
was the supposed author of his self-titled "Beast Files". This series of
2-page articles was perhaps the first time a character in any comic
universe was depicted to be keeping detailed profiles on other heroes
and villains. This format has been adopted since by many other books,
including most notably the Alex Ross series, Justice () which
had 2 profiles in each issue during the mini-series' 12 issue run. The
files appeared for over 2 years, and the column was voted the
fan-favorite. "Beast Files" was actually written by Benny R. Powell.


Reception

Beast has received positive reception as a comic book character and a
member of the X-Men. Wizard magazine ranked Beast the 180th greatest
comic book character of all time, on their list of the Top 200 Comic
Book Characters of All Time. IGN ranked Beast as the 58th greatest
comic book hero of all time stating that Beast embodies everything about
the mutant struggle in the  Universe. IGN also ranked Beast as
the 9th greatest X-Men member stating that when the world can accept
Henry McCoy, the X-Men will have succeeded in their mission, as #7
in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.
