COLONEL NICHOLAS JOSEPH "NICK" FURY is a fictional character appearing
in American comic books published by . Created by
writer/artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee, Fury first appeared in
Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 (May 1963), a World War II
combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an
elite U.S. Army unit. A popular character over a number of decades, in
2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and
32nd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers". He has sometimes been
considered an antihero.

The modern-day Fury, initially a CIA agent, debuted a few months later
in Fantastic Four #21 (Dec. 1963). In Strange Tales #135 (Aug.
1965), the character was transformed into a spy like James Bond and
leading agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The
character makes frequent appearances in  books as the former head
of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or
the United Nations and various superheroes. It is eventually revealed
that Fury takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that
halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a
century old.

Nick Fury appears in several  series set in alternate universes,
as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games
based on the comics. The character was first portrayed in live action by
David Hasselhoff in the 1998 television movie Nick Fury: Agent of
S.H.I.E.L.D._ Samuel L. Jackson later signed a nine-picture deal to
portray the character in the  Cinematic Universe franchise, first
appearing in the 2008 film Iron Man._ Jackson also cameos in
multiple episodes of the related  television show Agents of
S.H.I.E.L.D._ A version of the character appearing in 's Ultimate
 imprint was based on Jackson's appearance and screen persona,
well before he was cast in the role. The recognizability of the
character portrayed by Jackson in the films later led  to retire
the original character, replacing him with his African American son Nick
Fury, Jr., who like the Ultimate  version is patterned on Jackson.


Publication history

Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos

Fury initially appeared in the World War II combat series Sgt. Fury and
his Howling Commandos, as the cigar-chomping NCO who led a racially
and ethnically integrated elite unit. The series ran 167 issues (May
1963 – Dec. 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974).
Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, penciller Dick Ayers
began his long stint on what would be his signature series; John Severin
later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed
team. Roy Thomas succeeded Lee as writer, followed by Gary Friedrich,
for whom this became a signature series as well. Annuals featured the
"Howlers" called back to fight in the Korean War and Vietnam War.

The Howling Commandos encountered Office of Strategic Services agent
Reed Richards (later Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) in #3
(Sept. 1963), and fought alongside Captain America and Bucky in #13
(Dec. 1964).

Strange Tales and solo series

In Strange Tales #135 (Aug. 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a James
Bond-esque Cold War spy, with  introducing the covert organization
S.H.I.E.L.D. (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage
Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis Hydra . [Strange Tales#135
(Aug. 1965). Cover art by Jack Kirby and Frank Giacoia.] The 12-page
feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such
inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the Helicarrier — an
airborne aircraft carrier — as well as human-replicant LMDs (Life Model
Decoys), and even automobile airbags. Lee recalled in 2005,

Writer-penciller-colorist Jim Steranko began on the feature in Strange
Tales #151 (Dec. 1966), initially over Kirby layouts. He quickly
became one of comic books' most acclaimed and influential artists. In
some of the creative zeniths of the Silver Age, Steranko established the
feature as one of comic books' most groundbreaking and
innovative. He introduced or popularized in comic books such art
movements of the day as psychedelia and op art; built on Kirby's
longstanding work in photomontage; and created comic books' first
four-page spread. All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue,
barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness—and supplied his own version
of Bond girls, pushing what was allowable under the Comics Code at the
time.

The 12-page feature ran through Strange Tales #168 (sharing that
"split book" with the occult feature "Doctor Strange" each issue), after
which it was spun off into its own series, titled Nick Fury, Agent of
S.H.I.E.L.D. This ran 15 issues (June 1968 – Nov. 1969), followed by
three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970 – March
1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1-3 and #5, and drew the covers
of #1-7.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other  books, from
Fantastic Four to The Avengers. In 1972, Sgt. Fury and His Howling
Commandos celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the
squad, sponsored by Stan Lee and the creative team behind the title.
(Lee, like other comic books professionals, has made occasional cameos
in his own books, in a tradition going back to the 1940s Golden Age of
Comic Books). The matter of Fury apparently not aging significantly
since his term of service in World War II was justified in "Assignment:
The Infinity Formula" by writer Jim Starlin and artist Howard Chaykin in
 Spotlight #31 (Dec. 1976), revealing Fury's age-retarding
medication treatment.

A six-issue miniseries, Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D._ (June-Nov. 1988)
was followed by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D._ vol. 2. The
latter series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989 – May 1993); its pivotal
story arc was "the Deltite Affair", in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
were replaced with Life Model Decoys in a takeover attempt.

A year after that series ended, the one-shot Fury (May 1994), using
retroactive continuity, altered the events of those previous two series,
recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury
from the resurrection plans of Hydra head Baron von Strucker. The
following year, writer Chaykin and penciller Corky Lehmkuhl produced the
four-issue miniseries Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D._ (April–July 1995). Various
publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury's solo adventures,
such as the graphic novels and one-shots Wolverine – Nick Fury: The
Scorpio Connection (1989), Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising (Oct.
1994), Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty and Captain America/Nick Fury:
Blood Truce (both Feb. 1995), and Captain America/Nick Fury: The
Otherworld War (Oct. 2001). He starred in the 2004–2005 Secret War
miniseries.


Fictional character biography

Early life and wartime

Nicholas Joseph Fury is the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury
in New York City. His father is a United States citizen who enlists in
the United Kingdom's Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Jack enlists
in 1916 and is stationed in France. He shoots down Manfred von
Richthofen early in his flying career, and is a highly decorated combat
aviator by the end of the War in 1918.

Discharged after the War, Jack returns home, marries an unnamed woman,
and becomes the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the
late 1910s or early 1920s, is followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury (later the
supervillain Scorpio who co-founded the Zodiac cartel), and their
sister, Dawn.

All three children grow up in the neighborhood known as Hell's Kitchen,
Manhattan, New York. Nick is an amateur boxer through the Police
Athletic League where he learns marksmanship. As a teenager in 1937, he
went overseas for the first time to fight with the International
Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was on leave in Guernica when the
fascists bombed it.

After he returns to America, Fury and his friend Red Hargrove leaves the
neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on
a daring wing walking and parachuting act. Their death-defying stunts
while training British Commandos in 1940 catch the attention of
Lieutenant Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer, then serving with the British
Commandos, who enlists them for a special mission in the Netherlands.
Nick and Red later join the U.S. Army, with Fury undergoing Basic
Training under a Sergeant Bass. Nick and Red are stationed together at
Schofield Barracks, Hawaii when the Imperial Japanese Navy ambushes the
base on December 7, 1941. Red is among the many killed in the attack on
Pearl Harbor, with Fury swearing vengeance against both the Japanese and
the Nazis.

Sawyer, now a captain, assigns Fury command of the First Attack Squad, a
unit of U.S. Army Rangers, who are awarded the honorary title of
Commandos by Winston Churchill after their first missions. They are
nicknamed the "Howling Commandos" and stationed at a military base in
the United Kingdom to fight specialized missions, primarily but not
exclusively in the European Theatre of World War II. During this period,
Fury falls in love with a British nurse, Lady Pamela Hawley, who dies in
a bombing raid on London before he can propose to her.

C.I.A.

At the end of World War II in Europe, Fury is severely injured by a land
mine in France, and is found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg, who
uses him as a test subject for his INFINITY FORMULA. After making a full
recovery, Fury begins working for the Office of Strategic Services
(OSS), precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Six months
into his service, he learns the extent of Sternberg's life-saving
operation: the Infinity Formula has retarded his aging, but if he does
not receive annual doses, he will age rapidly and die. The doctor begins
a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange
for the injections. These events, culminating in the end of said
extortion, are detailed in  Spotlight #31 (Dec. 1976):
"Assignment: The Infinity Formula", by writer Jim Starlin and artist
Howard Chaykin. [A rare quiet moment for Nick Fury: Splash panel,
Strange Tales #168 (May 1968). Art by Steranko and Joe Sinnott.]

Fury segues into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in
Korea. During this time the Howling Commandos are reformed where Fury
receives a battlefield commission to lieutenant. He later reaches the
rank of colonel. During this time, he recommends the recruitment of
married agents Richard and Mary Parker, who will go on to become the
parents of Fury's occasional superhero ally Spider-Man. Much later, the
CIA uses him as a liaison to various superpowered groups that have begun
appearing, including the Fantastic Four, whom CIA agent Fury first
encounters in Fantastic Four #21 (Dec. 1963). Despite 's
"elastic chronology", which puts the early-1960s stories as roughly only
10 years before modern-day stories,  has never retconned an
explanation for that chronological discrepancy, as the company has for
many others.

During his time with the CIA, Fury begins wearing his trademark eyepatch
(an issue of Sgt. Fury had revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one
eye during the war, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the
course of years).

S.H.I.E.L.D.

Fury becomes the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. as its Public
Director. The ultimate authority of S.H.I.E.L.D. is revealed to be a
cabal of 12 mysterious men and women who give Fury his orders and
operational structure, leaving Fury to manage the actual implementation
of these orders and strategems. The identities of these people have
never been revealed; they appear only as shaded figures on monitors.
Initially, his organization's primary nemesis is the international
terrorist organization Hydra, created by Fury's worst enemy of World War
II, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (after retconning of the original
continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grows into one of the world's most
powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments and
forming strategic alliances with the Avengers and other superhero
groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon
becomes the superhero community's main contact when government-related
information is required in order to deal with a crisis.

After years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra have
both fallen under the control of a group of sentient Life Model Decoy
androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes to ground, hunted by his
fellow agents, many of whom are later revealed to have been replaced
with Deltites. Although Fury ultimately exposes and overcomes the
Deltite threat, the conflict is so destructive to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
personnel and infrastructure, and leaves Fury so disillusioned, that he
disbands the agency to prevent it from again being subverted from
within.

Fury rebuilds S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up, initially as a more
streamlined agency small enough for him to personally oversee and
protect from being corrupted. This new incarnation changed the acronym
to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics
Directorate".

Sometime later, Frank Castle, the vigilante known as the Punisher, is
captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D.
escort. During a hypnosis session with Doc Samson, a character named
Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury is
responsible for the murder of the Punisher's family. An escaped Punisher
eventually kills Fury, who is buried at Arlington National
Cemetery. The Fury that the Punisher has "killed" is later revealed
to have been a highly advanced Life Model Decoy android.

Returned to his post as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury independently
enlists the superheroes Captain America, Spider-Man, Luke Cage,
Wolverine, Daredevil, and the Black Widow to launch a covert assault on
the leadership of Latveria, which is plotting a massive attack on the
U.S. One year afterward, Latveria launches a counterattack that results
in Fury's removal as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander, forcing him again into
hiding with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His
successors as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. are first Maria Hill and then
Tony Stark. Both Hill and Stark, keeping Fury's disappearance secret
from the S.H.I.E.L.D. rank and file, use Life Model Decoys to
impersonate Fury on occasion.

Fury is the only "33rd-degree" S.H.I.E.L.D. officer, meaning he is the
only member of S.H.I.E.L.D., present or past, to know of the existence
of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe, secretly
providing the Anti-Registration faction in the subsequent superhuman
civil war with bases where they can rally their forces without worrying
about their Pro-Registration enemies finding them.

Secret Invasion

During the time Fury spends in hiding, he learns that Valentina Allegra
de Fontaine has been plotting to extract S.H.I.E.L.D. passcodes from him
and kill him. Fury kills her first, after which she reverts to the form
of an extraterrestrial shape-shifter from the hostile Skrull race, which
has mounted an invasion of Earth. He recruits Spider-Woman to be his
mole inside both Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D., and to watch for further Skrull
impostors. Unbeknownst to him, she's replaced shortly after by Skrull
Queen Veranke herself. He later instructs former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
Daisy Johnson to recruit superpowered children of various heroes and
villains to help combat the Skrull invasion; these include Phobos, the
10-year-old son of Ares and himself the young god of fear; Yo-Yo, a
misunderstood mutant speedster; Hellfire, a relative of Phantom Rider
with supernatural powers; Druid, a magician and son of Doctor Druid; and
Stonewall, a young man who can grow bigger at will and has super
strength. Fury dubs them his "Commandos".

Soon after the attack on Earth, Fury and his new team are seen
counter-attacking the Skrull attack in Times Square, Manhattan. They
manage to repel and kill the invaders in the area significantly, whilst
saving the downed Initiative cadets and the Young Avengers. He,
along with his team and the rescued heroes, are next seen working and
planning their next move in one of the scattered 28 covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
bases. He has been seen talking to Deadpool, while Deadpool was on a
Skrull ship after pretending to join them. It is revealed that Fury
hired Deadpool to infiltrate Skrull ranks by pretending to defect, with
the intention of obtaining biological information of the Skrulls that
Fury can use to stop them. When Deadpool attempts to transmit the data,
it is intercepted by Norman Osborn.

Fury leads the survivors of the Young Avengers and Initiative back to
the fight in New York, where they are joined by Thor, the new Captain
America, the New Avengers and the Mighty Avengers, the Hood's gang, and
the Thunderbolts, to take on Veranke's army of Super Skrulls.

When the battle is over and the real heroes are found, Nick is greeted
by the real Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and Dum Dum Dugan. He gives
them one look and teleports away with his Secret Warriors, not speaking
to his former friends.

Dark Reign and Secret Warriors

During an infiltration and elimination of a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. base in
Chicago, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is, and always has been,
secretly controlled by Hydra. A distraught Fury now plans to use his
Secret Warriors to combat the renewed Hydra threat, spearheaded by his
old nemesis, Baron Strucker. He hires the new Howling Commandos, a
private military company formed by 1200 former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who
refused to join Norman Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R., to employ them in his
fight against Hydra and Osborn. He has a number of inside men to
assist in his raids, including Natasha Romanova posing as Yelena
Belova who is in command of the Thunderbolts. Eventually, he and
his men commandeer decommissioned Helicarriers, as well as forcing the
H.A.M.M.E.R. agents at the dock to follow him. Natasha brings
Songbird to Fury, but she is followed and the three are captured by the
Thunderbolts. Osborn then shoots Fury in the head. It was not the
real Fury who was shot, but a Life Model Decoy in his image, which
the Fixer reveals to Songbird and Black Widow later after they escape
the Thunderbolts.

On a solo mission soon after, Fury teams with Norman Osborn to
interrogate a lower-level H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. The conversation (and
materials obtained afterwards) reveal there may be an organization much
like Hydra, installed in the upper levels of world governments, called
"Leviathan". This organization appears to have been founded by the
Soviet government for reasons as yet unclear. Fury later introduces
Daisy Johnson to prominent members of the Howling Commandos including
Alexander Pierce, leader of the second caterpillar team, and Mikel,
Fury's son and leader of the "gray" team.

Siege

Fury and the Secret Warriors are later summoned by Captain America to
his hideout along with the New and Young Avengers, when Rogers, seeking
to aid his long-time comrade Thor in his plight during the Siege of
Asgard launched by Norman Osborn, gathered all his allies to strike back
against Osborn and rescue Thor whilst simultaneously ending Osborn's
Dark Reign. Fury insists on Phobos remaining behind due to an
unwillingness for him to battle his father Ares and his youth, and later
opens a wormhole aboard an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. jet which brings the combined
forces of the three teams to Oklahoma. They then intercept
Norman Osborn's siege and with the help of Iron Man, who receives a
variation of his suit from Speed, they shut down Norman's suit. Their
victory is cut short when Sentry, now fully possessed by the Void,
begins attacking them. Loki attempts to help Fury and the other
heroes by empowering them with the Norn Stones, but Void kills him
before long. Iron Man then uses the ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier as a
bullet on the Void. Robert Reynolds regains control of his body and begs
the Avengers to kill him. Thor refuses but ends up killing him anyway
when Void begins to take over again. The Avengers are reunited and the
press declares that a new "Heroic Age" has begun.

Heroic Age

While Fury remains underground, allowing Steve Rogers to take official
command of the super-spy side of things, he remains in contact with
Earth's heroes and monitors their activities. He provides the New
Avengers with a special serum, created as a combination of the
Super-Soldier serum and the Infinity Formula, to help Mockingbird when
she was shot during a raid on a H.A.M.M.E.R. base. Fury later
expends the last sample of the Infinity Formula to save Bucky's life. He
remains immortal due to trace amounts of the formula in his body.

Battle Scars

In 2012, the six part series Battle Scars introduces Nick Fury's
secret son, SGT. MARCUS JOHNSON who is an African American and ends up
losing one eye in the series. The character has been described as
looking like Samuel L. Jackson, just as the Nick Fury of the Ultimate
Universe does. Nick Fury retires at the end of the series, and
his son joins S.H.I.E.L.D. Upon joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Johnson changes
his name to his original birth name of Nick Fury Jr., as he and Agent
Coulson appear on the Helicarrier in the final page.

Original Sin

During the Original Sin storyline, Nick Fury is called upon to help
investigate the murder of Uatu the Watcher. Fury is attacked and
beheaded by the Winter Soldier. When the investigating teams –
including Black Panther, Emma Frost, Doctor Strange and the Punisher –
attempt to pursue Bucky, they find a space station of unknown origin.
"Fury" is revealed to be a highly advanced Life Model Decoy, with the
space station containing the real, elderly, Nick Fury and several
LMDs. Fury relates an account from 1958, when as a member of U.S.
Army Intelligence, he encountered an invasion of alien Tribellians in
Kansas. He witnessed Woodrow McCord destroying the home planet of the
aliens, before himself being fatally injured. When McCord's partner
Howard Stark arrived on the scene, he decided to recruit Fury to
continue his work as defender of the planet. Nick Fury accepted, and
explains that over the decades, outside of spying on hippies and
socialists, and "destabilizing"/causing wars across countries on Earth
in his regular work with the Army, and later, S.H.I.E.L.D., he defended
the Earth against threats through virtually any means whatsoever,
including systematic torture against aliens, genocide against planetary
civilizations, and warmongering spanning entire galaxies. The corpses
discovered recently by the superhero investigators were threats that
Fury had neutralized. Fury reveals that he has rapidly grown elderly
and is dying because the Infinity Formula in his body has been depleted.
He explains that he chose each of the heroes assembled so that one of
them can replace him. His refusal to answer the Black Panther's demand
for an explanation of what happened to Uatu leads to a battle between
the heroes and the LMDs, during which Fury activates Uatu's eyes.
Fury fights off most of the attacking heroes – including revealing an
undisclosed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to wield
his hammer. Fury confesses that he killed Uatu in potential
self-defense after Doctor Midas and the Orb had first attacked him. Fury
took one of Uatu's eyes, needing to know who mounted the assault and
Uatu's oath preventing him from revealing that information directly.
After killing Midas, Fury is shown in chains wandering the Moon unable
to interfere, as Uatu's replacement, "the Unseen", while the Winter
Soldier takes his place as Earth's "Man on the Wall".


Powers, abilities, and equipment

According to the comic books, Nick Fury's aging has been slowed greatly
by the Infinity Formula, a serum created by Dr. Berthold Sternberg. Fury
was first inoculated with the serum in the 1940s. Fury took the serum
annually for many years. Originally Fury had to take the formula
annually or the effects would be reversed, allowing his body to reach
its actual chronological age. Nick Fury is depicted as an active
athletic man despite his advanced chronological age, though writers have
sometimes portrayed Fury as being past his prime despite the Infinity
Formula as in the Fury and Wolverine graphic novel. As of the
"Original Sin" story arc, it is revealed that at some point the Infinity
Formula stopped working for him and Fury has only pretended to stop
aging by using LMDs.

Fury's injured left eye, though initially minimally affected by a
grenade blast during World War II, has over the decades resulted in
a 95% loss of vision in this eye. Despite some comments to the contrary,
Fury has not had the eye removed, nor bionically enhanced, and he merely
covers it with a cosmetic eye-patch to prevent depth perception
distortion. He has explained that when needing to disguise himself, he
only needs to remove the eyepatch, slip in a contact lens and darken his
hair, as everyone always looks for a one-eyed man.

Fury is a seasoned unarmed and armed combat expert, was a heavyweight
boxer in the army (during World War II), and holds a black belt in Tae
Kwon Do and a brown belt in Jiu Jitsu. He has honed his unarmed combat
skills sparring with Captain America. The character is a combat veteran
of three wars, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam Conflict,
as well as numerous "military adviser" missions and clandestine
operations ("a dozen conflicts you've never even heard of"). He is
trained as a paratrooper, Ranger, a demolitions expert, vehicle
specialist (including aircraft and seagoing vessels), and a Green Beret.

Fury has access to a wide variety of equipment and weaponry designed by
S.H.I.E.L.D. technicians. He wears a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform made of 9-ply
Kevlar (able to withstand ballistic impact up to .45 caliber bullets)
and a Beta cloth (type C), a fire-resistant material, which has a
kindling temperature of . Fury uses various types of handguns, including
a .15 caliber needle gun, a government issue .45 caliber automatic, a
captured German Luger in 9mm Parabellum, a modified semi-automatic
Walther PPK in 9 mm Parabellum, and the Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol in
.45 ACP.

As the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has access to the entire
S.H.I.E.L.D. highly advanced arsenal of weaponry; various air, land, and
sea craft provided by S.H.I.E.L.D.; and numerous S.H.I.E.L.D.
paraphernalia, including a radio-link tie and a bulletproof suit. Due to
his high-ranking status, even when S.H.I.E.L.D. is directed by Tony
Stark, and then Norman Osborn, Fury retains access to several
S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouses and paraphernalia that are unknown to anyone
else but him.
