NAMOR THE SUB-MARINER (NAMOR MCKENZIE) is a fictional character
appearing in American comic books published by . Debuting
in early 1939, the character was created by writer-artist Bill Everett
for Funnies Inc., one of the first "packagers" in the early days of
comic books that supplied comics on demand to publishers looking to
enter the new medium. Initially created for the unreleased comic Motion
Picture Funnies Weekly, the Sub-Mariner first appeared publicly in
 #1 (Oct. 1939) – the first comic book from Timely
Comics, the 1930s–1940s predecessor of the company . During
that period, known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic
Books, the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely's top three characters, along
with Captain America and the original Human Torch. Everett said the
character's name was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem, "The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner". Everett came up with "Namor" by writing
down noble sounding names backwards and thought Roman/Namor looked the
best.

The mutant son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical
undersea kingdom of Atlantis, Namor possesses the super-strength and
aquatic abilities of the Homo mermanus race, as well as the mutant
ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. Through the
years, he has been alternately portrayed as a good-natured but
short-fused superhero, or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for
perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his
kingdom. The first known comic book antihero, the Sub-Mariner has
remained a historically important and relatively popular 
character. He has served directly with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four,
the Invaders, the Defenders, the X-Men, and the Illuminati as well as
serving as a foil to them on occasion.


Publication history

Golden Age

Namor the Sub-Mariner first appeared in April 1939 in the prototype for
a planned giveaway comic titled Motion Picture Funnies Weekly,
produced by the comic book packager Funnies Inc. The only eight known
samples among those created to send to theater owners were discovered in
the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. When the giveaway idea
fell through, creator Bill Everett used the character for 
Comics #1, the first comic book by Funnies, Inc. client Timely Comics,
predecessor of . The final panel of the earlier,
unpublished eight-page Sub-Mariner story had included a "Continued Next
Week" box that reappeared, sans lettering, in an expanded 12-page story.
The series  was retitled  Mystery Comics with
issue #2 (Dec. 1939). [Namor's first cover appearance:  Mystery
Comics #4 (Feb. 1940). Art by Alex Schomburg.] In his first appearances
Namor was an enemy of the United States. Comics historian Les Daniels
noted that "Namor was a freak in the service of chaos. Although the
Sub-Mariner acted like a villain, his cause had some justice, and
readers reveled in his assaults on civilization. His enthusiastic fans
weren't offended by the carnage he created as he wrecked everything from
ships to skyscrapers." Everett's antihero would eventually battle
Carl Burgos' android superhero, the Human Torch, when in 1940 Namor
threatened to sink the island of Manhattan underneath a tidal wave.
When the U.S. entered World War II, Namor would aid the Allies of World
War II against Adolf Hitler and the Axis powers. Supporting
characters included Betty Dean, a New York City policewoman introduced
in  Mystery Comics #3 (and later known as Betty
Dean-Prentiss), who was a steady companion, and his cousins Namora and
Dorma.

Namor starred in the Golden Age comic book Sub-Mariner Comics,
published quarterly, then thrice-yearly, and finally bimonthly, from
issues #1–32 (Fall 1941 – June 1949). A backup feature each issue
starred the detective-superhero the Angel. Along with many other Timely
characters, Namor disappeared a few years after the end of World War II
and the decline in popularity of superhero comics. He briefly fought
crime as a member of the post-war superhero team the All-Winners Squad,
and, through a 1970s retcon, was given a history of having fought with
the Allies during World War II in the superhero team the Invaders. Both
these super-groups were built around the core of Namor, Captain America,
and the original Human Torch.

The Sub-Mariner experienced a brief revival in the mid-1950s at Atlas
Comics, the 1950s iteration of . Along with Captain America and
the original Human Torch, he was revived in Young Men #24. Soon
afterward, Sub-Mariner Comics was revived with issues #33–42 (April
1954 – Oct. 1955). During this time, Namora had her own spin-off
series. A planned live-action television program starring Namor did not
appear and the revival of the comic book series was cancelled a second
time.

Silver Age and after

Namor returned in Fantastic Four #4 (May 1962), where a member of the
titular superhero team, Johnny Storm, the new Human Torch, discovers him
living as an amnesiac homeless man in the Bowery section of
Manhattan. Storm helps him recover his memory, and Namor
immediately returns to his undersea kingdom – identified, for the first
time in the  canon, as Atlantis. Finding it destroyed from nuclear
testing, Namor assumes his people are scattered and that he will never
find them. He again becomes an antihero during this period, as two
elements – a thirst for vengeance and a quest for identity – would
dominate the Sub-Mariner stories of the 1960s. He was both a villain and
a hero – striking against the human race who destroyed his home, but
showing a great deal of noblesse oblige to individuals.

Sol Brodsky. ]

Initially, Namor variously finds himself allied with the supervillains
Doctor Doom and Magneto, but his royal nobility and stubborn independent
streak make these alliances-of-convenience short-lived. Namor's revival
was a hit with readers, but  could not give him his own title due
to publication and distribution restrictions that would not be lifted
until 1968. Instead, Namor was given numerous guest-appearances –
including in Daredevil #7 (April 1965), a rare superhero story drawn
by comics great Wally Wood – and a starring feature in the split-title
comic Tales to Astonish (beginning issue #70, Aug. 1965). By now,
during a period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books,
he is more authoritative, arrogant and solemn than the impetuous
youthful character of the 1940s and mid-1950s, speaking in
neo-Shakespearean dialogue rather than the more colloquial speech of his
youth, often shouting his battle cry, "Imperius Rex!".

He was spun off into his own title, the 1968–74 series
Sub-Mariner. The super-villain Tiger Shark was introduced in issue
#5 by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema and the super-hero
Stingray in issue #19 by Thomas and Bill Everett. Some of the later
issues of this Sub-Mariner series are notable for having been written
and drawn by the character's creator, Bill Everett, shortly before his
death; as well, they reintroduced a now-older Namora, and introduced her
daughter, Namorita Prentiss. By now more of a reluctant superhero "the
Sub-Mariner was perfect for the  Age of angst-ridden protagonists.
Noble yet misunderstood, powerful yet thwarted ... [he was] portrayed as
a regal monarch – a king without a country." The final issue, #72
(Sept. 1974), was written by Steve Skeates and featured an unofficial
intercompany crossover with the last issue of ' Aquaman
series. A five- to six-page backup feature, "Tales of Atlantis",
chronicling the undersea kingdom from its ancient origins, appeared in
issues #62–66 (June–Oct. 1973), written by Gerber, with penciling by
Howard Chaykin and later Jim Mooney. After the cancellation of
Sub-Mariner, Namor co-starred with Doctor Doom in the Super-Villain
Team-Up series. The series suffered from mediocre sales due to its
lack of a stable creative team, and following issue #13 Namor was
dropped from the co-star spot.

Following a four-issue miniseries a decade later, Prince Namor, the
Sub-Mariner (Sept.-Dec. 1984), by co-writer J. M. DeMatteis,
penciler/co-writer Bob Budiansky, and inker Danny Bulanadi, the 12-issue
maxiseries The Saga of the Sub-Mariner (Nov. 1988 – Oct. 1989)
provided a retrospective of Namor's past adventures while tying up loose
plot threads and resolving contradictions that had accumulated over the
character's decades of published history. Namor again received an
ongoing series in 1990. Namor, the Sub-Mariner, which ran 62 issues
(April 1990 – May 1995), was initially written and penciled by John
Byrne who took over the inking as well from issues #4–21. From
#26–38, the series' penciler and eventual penciler-inker was
then-newcomer Jae Lee, with Bob Harras scripting from #33–40. Thereafter
came a variety of artists and writers. This series followed Namor as CEO
of Oracle, Inc., a corporation devoted to reducing pollution,
particularly in the oceans, and provided the stage for the return of the
1970s martial artist superhero Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead.

The 12-issue miniseries Namor (June 2003 – May 2004), credited to
co-writers Bill Jemas (then 's president) and Andi Watson, and
penciled initially by Salvador Larroca and later by Pat Olliffe and
others, explored Namor's youth, charting his teenage romance with a
young American girl in the early 20th century. A six-issue miniseries,
Sub-Mariner vol. 2 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), by co-writers Matt
Cherniss and Peter Johnson and, primarily, artist Phil Briones,
introduced Namor's heretofore undisclosed son, Kamar.

Namor was featured in his own ongoing series, Namor: The First Mutant,
in 2011. The series was cancelled after less than a year into its
publication.

Never fundamentally either a hero or a villain, Namor has protected his
kingdom and sought vengeance on the surface world only when he feels his
realm is threatened. Although he has served alongside, or even as a
member of, superhero teams – most notably the Defenders, a
"non-team" in which he was allied with Doctor Strange, the Hulk, and the
Silver Surfer; the Avengers; and both the World War II and modern-day
versions of the Invaders – Namor remains an outsider.

 revived the series The Defenders, with Namor on the team, in
December 2011. The series was cancelled after 12 issues.

He became one of main characters, along with the other Illuminati
members, in the third volume of New Avengers beginning in 2013.


Fictional character biography

As related in  #1 (cover-dated Oct. 1939) and subsequent,
expanded retellings of his origin story, Namor was born in the capital
city of the initially unnamed Atlantean empire, then located off the
Antarctic coast. His mother was Emperor Thakorr's daughter, Fen, and his
father an American sea captain, Leonard McKenzie, of the icebreaker
Oracle; they had fallen in love and married aboard ship while she was,
unbeknownst to him, spying on the human intruders. When Fen did not
return, Atlantean warriors attacked the Oracle, evidently killing
McKenzie, and returned Fen to her kingdom. The pink-skinned mutant Namor
was subsequently born among the blue-skinned Atlanteans. He became the
Prince of Atlantis, and a warrior for his people against the
"surface-dwellers". He became friends with New York City police woman
Betty Dean in  Mystery Comics #3 (Jan. 1940), and when World War
II broke out, he began fighting the Axis powers. In flashback stories
beginning in the 1970s, he was retconned as a member of the Allied
superhero team the Invaders, consisting originally of himself; Captain
America and his sidekick Bucky; and the original Human Torch and his
sidekick Toro.

Namor was injured after the war, and in Fantastic Four #4 was shown
living in the flophouse Bowery district of Manhattan as an amnesiac
derelict. Regaining his memory in this story, he became enraged upon
learning that the original site of Atlantis had been destroyed by
nuclear testing, its inhabitants evacuated. Namor vowed revenge on
humanity, but after several attacks thwarted by superheroes, including
in Fantastic Four #6, 9, and 14 (Sept. and Dec. 1962, May 1963),
Strange Tales #107 (April 1963), he found his people and launched an
unsuccessful invasion of New York City in Fantastic Four Annual #1
(1963). [Sub-Mariner #67 (Nov. 1973), introducing the short-lived
mid-1970s costume. Cover art by John Romita and Mike Esposito.]

Namor Mackenzie returned to Atlantis to marry his royal cousin, Lady
Dorma. In Sub-Mariner #37 (May 1971), the evil princess Llyra of
Lemuria, another undersea culture, kidnapped and replaced Dorma at the
wedding, hoping to usurp Namor's kingdom. Though Namor's marriage to
Dorma was still official, she died as a result of Llyra's
machinations. Namor quickly went through another trauma in issues
#43–44 (Nov.-Dec. 1971) when he finally met his father, long thought
dead, only to lose him when McKenzie gave his life in battle against the
supervillain Tiger Shark.

Namor allied with the "non-team" the Defenders initially in 
Feature #1–3, Dec. 1971 – June 1972, then in the series The
Defenders. After being deposed from his throne, Namor joined the
superhero team the Avengers. He was briefly married to Marrina,
an aquatic alien and a member of the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight.
She was later presumed killed, but she was later revealed to be in a
coma, of which Namor is unaware.

Father-daughter oceanographers Caleb and Carrie Alexander, theorizing
that Namor's propensity toward rage was due to his half-human
half-Atlantean blood chemistry, equipped Namor with a monitor to warn
when Namor had to seek either air or water. This allowed Namor to
control his metabolism. In his 1990–1995 series Namor, the
Sub-Mariner, he collected sunken treasures to finance his secret
purchase of a corporation he renamed Oracle Inc., which he turned to
conservation and environmental purposes. Later, Namor lost his
ankle-wings during a battle with the animated garbage-monster Sluj,
but they were later restored. While continuing his business endeavors,
Namor traveled to the dimension of K'un-L'un, where he found and brought
back the superhero Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead for many
months. He reunited with his mother, Fen, who died defending her son
from an attack. Namor once again ruled Atlantis, and Oracle began
sponsoring the charitable super-group Heroes for Hire.

In the one-shot New Avengers: Illuminati (May 2006), Namor is revealed
to have been a member for several years of the clandestine policy group
the Illuminati, with Mister Fantastic, Iron Man, Doctor Strange,
Professor X, and Black Bolt. In the series Sub-Mariner vol. 2, #1–6
(Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), he discovers his long-lost son Kamar, who
attempts to usurp the throne of Atlantis but is killed by the
supervillain Nitro.

During the Fear Itself storyline, Namor enlists the aid of Lyra, Loa,
Silver Surfer, and Doctor Strange after he is ousted from his kingdom by
Attuma, who was transformed into Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. They later
get attacked by the Undying Ones, demons who break through Earth's
dimension as a result of the global panic weakening the barriers between
the dimensions and who make a deal with Nerkodd to help them take over
Earth.

When the X-Men relocated to Utopia off the coast of San Francisco, Namor
decided to assist them due to his sympathy with their status as
outsiders. As a result, he sided with the X-Men during the subsequent
war with the Avengers over the coming of the Phoenix Force to Earth,
eventually becoming one of the 'Phoenix Five' when the Phoenix Force was
fractured between himself, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus and Magik.
Captain America attempted to arrange a meeting of the Illuminati to talk
with Namor, but the rest of the group left before Namor arrived, and
Namor refused to stand down when Rogers tried to appeal to him. He
was eventually defeated by a mass attack from the Avengers when he
attacked Wakanda, becoming the first of the Phoenix Five to fall.

Having recovered his senses after his time as one of the Phoenix Five,
Namor rejoins the Illuminati when Black Panther calls for their aid -
Beast replacing the deceased Professor X - in dealing with an incursion
event as an alternate universe threatens to collide with their own.
Although they were forced to destroy the other Earth to protect their
own, the Illuminati resolved to continue protecting their Earth from
such events, only for Namor to act against the other members when he
detonated an anti-matter device to destroy another Earth when the others
could not bring themselves to do it. Believing that the Illuminati's
morality was holding them back, Namor assembled a new Cabal to deal with
the incursions, but despite the team achieving legitimacy as Earth's
protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out
in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with
the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the
next Earth to be destroyed, the Black Panther and Black Bolt left him
behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions.
Unbeknownst to the Avengers, that world had a second simultaneous
Incursion happen, allowing Namor and the Cabal to escape to the third
Earth, in the Ultimate Universe.

Eight months after the events of the 2015 Secret Wars companywide
crossover, the members of the new Squadron Supreme evacuated and
destroyed Atlantis after deeming it to be a threat to world peace.
Hyperion decapitated Namor in retaliation for the worlds destroyed by
the Cabal, killing him, then also killed Attuma and other Atlantean
soldiers present.


Powers and abilities

Because of his unusual genetic heritage, Namor is unique among both
ordinary humans and Atlanteans; he is sometimes referred to as "'s
first mutant", because, while the majority of his observed superhuman
powers come from the fact that he's a hybrid of human and Atlantean DNA,
his ability to fly can't be explained by either side (Atlanteans are an
offshoot of "baseline" humanity); though, in terms of in-continuity
chronology, there were many mutants in existence before Namor. Namor
possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea
pressures, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, flight, and
longevity. Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite
periods, and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to
see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Bill Everett, in his first Sub-Mariner story, described the character as
"an ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in
the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men". No other
powers were mentioned. When the series was revived in 1954 , Namor lost
his ankle wings and with them the power of flight; they, and his full
strength, were restored in Sub-Mariner #38 (Feb. 1955), in which
Everett additionally wrote a flashback story, "Wings on His Feet",
detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14. This story was twice
reprinted during the Silver Age of Comic Books, in  Super-Heroes
#17 (Nov. 1968), and in the book Comix by Les Daniels.

Namor possesses wings on his ankles to which he attributes his power of
flight. On occasions when they have been lost or badly damaged, he has
experienced a loss of flying ability. He could not fly as a child, and
the power only manifested when the wings developed in adolescence.

Namor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds, even by Atlantean
standards.

Namor has greater longevity than a normal human being. He is well over
90 years old as he was born in 1920 in the  timeline, but has the
appearance of a male in his prime. His identity as a pre-World War II
superhero is well-established, making him less subject to the sliding
timescale of the  universe.

During Namor's original fight with the Human Torch in  Mystery
Comics #8 (June 1940, and the first fight between superheroes to appear
in any media), Namor was able to forcibly expel water from his body to
extinguish fires, although it proved useless against the Torch.

After he was revived yet again in the 1960s by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby,
Namor demonstrated powers of various sealife that had not been shown in
earlier stories. An editorial note in  Tales #9 (July 1967),
stated explicitly that "nautical Namor has since lost his power to
imitate the characteristics of fish..." According to one of
Sub-Mariner's scripters, Roy Thomas: "As for Namor's electrical and
other sea-creaturely powers. They were used in one or two stories in
F.F._ and the Human Torch series in Strange Tales, then dropped – as
one of Stan [Lee] and Jack [Kirby]s early (and quite forgivable)
mistakes. The explanation, given in a reprint of a Torch/Namor bout a
few years later, was that he had these powers only for a short time and
then lost them."

In all his incarnations, Namor possesses superhuman strength and, with
the possible exceptions of Orka and Tyrak at their full sizes, is the
strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is
dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn't be
submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a
water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater viscosity. His
strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water,
though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it
would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long
as he keeps himself wet. Namor possesses superhuman stamina and
resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor's strength level is
such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as
powerful as the Hulk in the past.

Some stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing
underwater, e.g., in Namor, the Sub-Mariner #5, Namor thinks "this New
York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs". and artists
such as Salvador Larroca have drawn him with gill slits on either side
of his neck. In The Sub-Mariner #18–22 (1969–70), beings from
outer space surgically closed Namor's gills for a time, leaving him with
the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other
sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes
that allow him to breathe underwater.

Namor possesses a telepathic rapport with all forms of marine life. He
is able to mentally communicate with most forms of marine life and can
mentally persuade them to do his bidding. Namor can also mentally
communicate with other Atlanteans (giving mental-telepathic orders to
all his men).

Due to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature (not shared by Namorita), it
was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood
that trigger manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent imbalances by
regular immersion in water.

Namor gives off a sense of charisma which most women tend to find
captivating. Many of the ladies that have entered his life made clear
their attraction to his masculine, slightly alien personality in ways
both subtle and blatant. He reacts to such advances with gratitude
tinged with a slight distance born of monarchical etiquette.

Namor is a natural leader, trained by the royal family of Atlantis as
befitting an heir to the throne. He has historically led troops into
battle with expert success. His typical interpersonal behavior with both
subject and friend borders on the aloof; this is more a sense of regal
noblesse oblige rather than snobbishness.

Namor was given possession of the Time Gem. This gem allows the user
total control over the past, present, and future. It allows time travel,
can age and de-age beings, and can be used as a weapon by trapping
enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. After the Hood
attempted to steal the Gems, Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem
from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it, before
being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the
new Illuminati – Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt – once again.

Namor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court, and
speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. He is a highly skilled business
executive.

Formerly depicted abilities

In The Fantastic Four #9 (Dec. 1962), Namor states, "I have the powers
of all the creatures who live beneath the sea! I can charge the very air
with electricity – using the power of the electric eel!" In the same
issue, "the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the
sea" enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is
invisible. He uses "the power to surround himself with electricity in
the manner of an electric eel" again in Strange Tales #107 (April
1963), and #125 (Oct. 1964); in the former he manifests the power to
inflate his body like a puffer fish. These extra powers were ignored,
when  gave Namor his own feature beginning in Tales to Astonish
#70 (Aug. 1965).

Another ability unknown in the Golden Age and rarely displayed is his
empathic rapport with many forms of marine life. He had a limited
empathic rapport with Namorita. But, only as a result of being given one
of her "magic earrings" (which has long-since disappeared).

An editorial note in  Tales #9 (July 1967), which reprinted the
story from Strange Tales #107, stated explicitly that "nautical Namor
has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish..." His
electrical abilities were seen out of comic continuity in 1991's
Spider-Man: The Video Game. Furthermore, Namor employed these "lost"
powers semi-regularly in his 1990s series, under John Byrne's pen.


"'s First Mutant"

 has repeatedly identified Namor as "'s first mutant", which
is true with regard to the order in which the character appeared in
print. He is not the oldest mutant within the fictional  Universe
timeline. A number of mutants predate him, including Selene (active
since at least 10,000 BC), Apocalypse (born in the 30th century BC),
Exodus (born in the 12th century AD), Wolverine (late 19th century AD),
Mystique and Destiny (dates of birth unknown, but known to have been
active at the "Dawn of the 20th century"), the demonic mutant Azazel,
and a group of mutants known as the Externals.

In X-Men #6 (July 1964), X-Men leader Professor Xavier and antagonist
Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant and make efforts to recruit him.
Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid, not a
mutant, in order to distinguish him from the mutant X-Men. When the
series was revived in 1990, the series title logo carried the subtitle
"'s first and mightiest mutant!".

Namor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and human physiology, although
he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans (Homo
mermanus) nor humans (Homo sapiens) possess. These include his
ability to fly, and possibly his durability and strength (which is
several times that of an Atlantean).

In the first issue of the five part Illuminati miniseries, after being
experimented on by the Skrulls, it was confirmed that Namor is not only
an Atlantean/human hybrid but also a mutant.

X-Men

Namor has joined forces with the X-Men. He claims to have done so
out of respect for Scott Summers and because "while there are some who
would stand with the many against the few, Namor will never be among
them".

Other versions

 Noir

In the  Noir reality, Namor is a captain of a ship named
"Dorma". CAPTAIN NAMOR is a widely infamous pirate of the seven seas
and an associate of Tony Stark, who pays him for the numerous voyages on
his adventures. Namor considers himself as a man of the sea and doesn't
share any allegiances to any countries or nations. As part of his
tradition as a pirate, Namor marks himself and his crew by slicing their
ears to look like shark's fins. He is the captain of the Dorma, an
advanced submarine while taking the guise of a fishing trawler.

In May 1939, Namor was hired by Stark in finding the location of
Atlantis. He traveled with Stark, James Rhodes, and Pepper Potts on the
submersible, the "Happy Hogan", in locating Atlantis and finding the
valuable Orichalcum. Upon returning to the surface, Namor and his
friends were immediately captured by the Nazis led by Baron Zemo and Von
Strucker, and the Orichalcum stolen by them. Namor and his allies were
then left to die on his trawler by torpedo; Namor took action in having
everyone quickly board the Dorma and escape before the torpedo destroyed
the trawler. Namor later rescued Stark following the destruction of Von
Strucker's airship fleet, as (in Namor's words) Stark owes him a boat
for the destruction of his.

MC2

Namor is still active in the MC2 future timeline, and still uniting
occasionally for battle alongside the Hulk and Doctor Strange as
"Defenders". His appearance, while slightly older looking, is unchanged
save for growing a goatee. In Fantastic Five vol. 2 #1 it was revealed
that he had held Doctor Doom captive for over ten years, after the mad
monarch destroyed Atlantis. Doom subsequently escaped, and in #4, Namor
is seen being tortured by him. He is freed after Reed Richards
sacrifices himself to send both his and Doom's consciousnesses to the
Crossroads of Infinty.

Ultimate 

In Ultimate Fantastic Four #24, the team is surveying the ruins of
Atlantis and finds an estimated 9,000-year-old tomb containing the
hibernating Namor – an imprisoned Atlantean criminal, considered the
worst villain of his time. Reed Richards' translation of the Atlantean
language reveals Namor's claims of kingship to be false.

His extreme intelligence allows him to become fluent in English in a
matter of minutes merely by listening to S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the
Fantastic Four talking. Confronting the human, Namor withstands
full-strength flares from the Human Torch and is strong enough to fight
the Thing, withstand Sue Storm's force fields, and stretch Richards (Mr.
Fantastic) to near-breaking. He destroys machinery designed to contain
the Hulk. Though beaten by the Fantastic Four, he creates a tidal wave
in the shape of Poseidon, threatening to destroy Manhattan with it. He
is appeased when he demands, and receives, a meaningful kiss from Sue
Storm. He then returns to the sea.

Namor reappears at the end of issue #55, rescuing an unconscious Sue
after she was attacked by the Ultimate version of the Salem's Seven.
Later, he is seen in Latvaria as Doom's prisoner.

Ultimate Namor is a mutant Atlantean with amphibious physiology suited
for high water pressure. He has vast super strength, durability, high
speed swimming ability, flight, and water manipulation.

1602

In the  1602 limited series Fantastick Four, Namor is
reinvented as NUMENOR, Emperor of Bensaylum, a city beyond the edge of
the world.

When the characters arrive in his realm he is arguing with his cousin
Rita (Namorita) about her reluctance to marry. She suggests that this is
because he refuses to find a consort himself. Upon meeting the Four from
the Fantastick, he is attracted to Susan Storm, and attempts to woo her,
unsuccessfully. He later plots with Otto von Doom to win her, while
"disposing" of Sir Richard Reed. Doom turns against him, and Numenor is
stabbed with his own trident and dies. Because Bensaylum is not
underwater, its inhabitants are portrayed as basically human although
they retain the pointed ears.

Earth-110

Namor assisted Doctor Doom, Hulk, Magneto, Red Skull, and Ultron in a
plot to take over New York.

 Zombies

In the  Zombies universe, Namor has a cameo as a zombie in the
original  Zombies limited series.

House of M

To follow up on Scarlet Witch's alteration of reality, Namor was
considered the "first mutant" in the reality that she created under
Quicksilver's approval. He represented Atlantis when he was meeting with
Magneto.

Exiles

In Exiles issues 14 and 15, Namor appears as a king who has taken over
Latveria. Another version of Namor is black and is married to
Sue Storm and has a son Remy.

Earth X

In the Earth X series Namor suffers from dementia. He is responsible
for the death of Johnny Storm. As a result, Franklin Richards used his
powers to cause half of Namor's body to be continually on fire.

Earth 9602 (Amalgam Comics)

Namor is combined with ' King of Atlantis, Aquaman to create
Aqua Mariner.

Other

A Namor from another time appears with the three original Defenders to
battle the forces of the Red Hulk and his Offenders, due to a bet made
by the Elders of the Universe.

Mini 

Namor appears in the "Mini " backup feature in World War
Hulk.

Sub-Mariner: The Depths

The character receives a macabre overhaul in this dark  Knights
mini-series set in an alternate 1950s. Namor is a fabled being among
mariners, said to pursue and kill any searching for Atlantis. Randolph
Stein, a man who makes a living debunking modern myths, is hired to find
Atlantis and, along with his submarine crew, encounters Namor in the
ocean depths.


Reception

Namor was listed as the 88th greatest comic book character by Wizard
magazine. IGN ranked Namor as the 77th greatest comic book hero of
all time opining that "With the Atlanteans and X-Men both seeking their
place in a dangerous world, Namor's role as leader is more vital than
ever", and 14th in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers". In 2013,
ComicsAlliance ranked Namor as #16 on their list of the "50 Sexiest Male
Characters in Comics".

Film

Filmmaker Philip Kaufman had been in discussions with  Studios to

following year. They hoped for filming to begin in 2003 for a summer
2004 release, but development stalled for two years until Chris
Columbus entered talks to direct in July 2004 and the release date
was subsequently moved to 2007. Columbus departed in 2005, and
Universal replaced him with Jonathan Mostow in September 2006. In
2012,  CCO Joe Quesada thought Namor's film rights had reverted to
, but in August 2013 it was revealed by  Studios President
Kevin Feige that this was not the case, and the rights remained at
Universal Pictures. Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter stated in
May 2014 that  now has the rights for Namor. On June 3,
2014, Kit confirmed that , not Universal now has the Namor film
rights. On July 18, 2014, Feige told IGN in an interview that the

sorted out.
