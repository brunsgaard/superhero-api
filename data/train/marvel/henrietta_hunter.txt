Publication history

In X-Statix #13, Peter Milligan had planned to use Diana, Princess of
Wales in a storyline which featured her returning from the dead as a
mutant superhero. News of this leaked out to the media and there
followed a series of objections, most notably from the British tabloid
newspaper The Daily Mail. Quesada and  announced that they would
alter the character of Princess Diana, replacing her with a fictional
pop star, Henrietta Hunter (still physically resembling Diana, but with
black hair and a different hairdo).


Fictional character biography

Henrietta Hunter was a "pop star" from the fictional country of
"Europa". She was the one-time leader of the X-Statix.


Powers and abilities

She was a mutant with empathic powers, the ability to read and feel the
emotions of others. She could sense the pain of others. After the first
time she returned from the dead, she not only regained her empathic
abilities, but also increased athletic prowess and the ability to
communicate with ghostly spirits. Following her second death, Henrietta
once again returned in a zombie-like form. In this form, she, like other
zombies, did not appear to require food or oxygen to survive. She also
appeared to be able to cause unlikely events to happen that would cause
death to those who sung her song. It is unknown whether she retained any
of her previous powers, as she did not display any as a corpse.
