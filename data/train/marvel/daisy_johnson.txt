Avengers series, from issue #19 (January 2012) through its final issue

Fictional character biography

Johnson, a superhuman with seismic (earthquake-producing) powers, is the
illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the supervillain known as Mister
Hyde. Taken in by S.H.I.E.L.D., she is under the careful eye of its
longtime executive director, Nick Fury, even after the latter's
defection from the agency during the events of the Secret War series.
Daisy herself was a participant in this incident, where Fury used
trickery, lies and outright brainwashing in order to secure a superhero
team to overthrow the legitimate government of Latveria. This later
resulted in a terror attack on American soil; Daisy destroys the cyborg
leader. She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known
agent aside from Fury and the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova) to do so.

In her most visible action, Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful
mutant leader Magneto by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him
lose consciousness. This was during a three-way confrontation with the
X-Men, Avengers and the "Collective" - a powered being carrying
thousands of mutant energy signatures. Daisy states in this appearance
that if she were to join the superhero team the Avengers, she would
adopt the moniker "Quake".

The Avengers had splintered due to the events of Civil War, and she is
later seen reunited with Nick Fury, in disguise, who gives her new
orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in
order to assist him with the threat against the Skrulls in their Secret
Invasion. Taking on the name Quake, she and her teammates attack the
Skrulls during their invasion of Manhattan. The team becomes a part
of Fury's Secret Warriors, with Daisy acting as field leader of the
Caterpillars.

While investigating Norman Osborn's escape from the Raft, Johnson is
drafted by Captain America into the Avengers under her superhero name
Quake. She is tasked with tracking down how Osborn appeared via hologram
in the middle of a supposedly secure press conference. Daisy takes
over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury fully retires and his
son joins as an agent. Maria Hill is the Acting Director of
S.H.I.E.L.D., while Johnson is still considered Director of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Johnson was indefinitely suspended after launching an
unsanctioned operation to assassinate Andrew Forson, the Scientist
Supreme, leader of the supposedly legitimate A.I.M. Island. Hill is
promoted to Director in her place.

In the S.H.I.E.L.D._ series, Daisy later reveals to her father that she
has uncovered the origin of her abilities: she is an Inhuman whose
genetic abilities were activated by her father's unstable DNA. The
nickname "Skye", Daisy's original name from the show, is also introduced
to comics as Coulson's affectionate name for her.


Powers and abilities

Daisy generates powerful waves of vibrations which can produce effects
resembling those of earthquakes. She is immune to any harmful effects of
the vibrations. She also has or was given a form of psychic shielding.

She's also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, skilled all-around athlete,
and excellent marksman. She was a leading espionage agent, adept at
undercover assignments.

Her training under Fury enables her to target her seismic waves with
pinpoint accuracy, causing targeted objects to vibrate themselves apart,
from the inside out. This is shown in her being able to prevent the
detonation of an antimatter bomb implanted in the body of Lucia von
Bardas by destroying its power supply, and exploding the heart of
Wolverine while in his chest, to halt an enraged attack on S.H.I.E.L.D.
Director Nick Fury.


Other versions

During the "Age of Ultron" storyline (which took place in an alternate
reality where Ultron nearly annihilated the human race), Daisy Johnson
is among the superheroes in the resistance against Ultron.

Quake has appeared alongside Tigra, Wonder Man, and The Vision in the
Ultimate line of comics. It is later revealed that prior to becoming
Quake, Daisy Johnson was a S.H.I.E.L.D. cadet who was discharged from
the organization after fighting back against an attempted sexual assault
from a superior. She was then approached by Nick Fury, who offered her
superpowers in exchange for joining his West Coast Ultimates. The
project was shut down and later reactivated by a corrupt California
governor who sent them after the Ultimates. Quake decided to
surrender for the greater good and tell President Steve Rogers the whole
plan, who managed to put an end to it along with the rest of the
Ultimates.

    Universe, executive producer Jed Whedon said, "Weâ€™ve created a
    different origin for her... We merged those two ideas together also

    original story points from the comics, they will smell story points
    from miles away. Those two factors led us to coming up with a
