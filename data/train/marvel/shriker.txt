Origin

Jack grew up as a friend of Dan Ketch. He also studied the martial arts
under sensei Yugi Watanabe. One day a motorcycle gang entered the garage
where Dan and Jack frequented. They were on the run from Mister Hyde,
and locked the two up. Dan turned into Ghost Rider and defeated the
group as well as Hyde. Later, Jack and his sensei were targeted by
Deathwatch. Jack was injured, and later abducted from the hospital.
However, Ghost Rider was able to free him with the help of Yugi's son
Brass (Sean Watanabe) and Wolverine. Some time later, Ghost Rider found
himself assisted by the mysterious Shriker. Jack eventually revealed
that he was Shriker. However, Dan asked him to stay out of the Ghost
Rider's conflicts, as things were getting too dangerous.

living in Canada and therefore outside of Tony Stark's jurisdiction.
