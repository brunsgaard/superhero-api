Fictional character biography

Nightside is a long-time member of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.

She was with the Imperial Guard the first time they fought the X-Men.

Nightside was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a
time.

Like Oracle, she was injured by Vulcan. Unlike several of her fellow
Guardsman, Nightside survived and was seen soon after battling the X-Men
and the Starjammers. However, during the attack on the Kree homeworld,
she was slain by an Inhuman soldier.


Powers and abilities

Nightside possessed various abilities stemming from the Darkforce
dimension, most notably the power to generate absolute darkness in an
unspecified radius, and the ability to displace individuals into the
Darkforce dimension, subjecting them to a metaphysical sense of cold and
fear, much like the power of Cloak. Her powers were apparently a natural
attribute of her race. Though she wielded her abilities with great
skill, Nightside's greatest fear was that she would someday be consumed
by them.


Inspiration

Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based
on members of the  team Legion of Super-Heroes. (Dave Cockrum,
co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.)
Nightside is based on LSH member Shadow Lass.
