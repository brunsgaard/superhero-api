Publication history

[Cover to Strange Tales #169 (Sept. 1973). Art by John Romita,
Sr.|thumb|left] Brother Voodoo starred in his own feature in the 
comic-book series Strange Tales #169-173 (Sept. 1973 - April 1974),
and in a backup feature in the black-and-white horror-comics magazine
Tales of the Zombie #6 (July 1974, in a story continuing from Strange
Tales #173) and #10 (March 1975). He has gone to guest-star very
sporadically in other  series, into the 21st century.

Brother Voodoo's name was then changed to "Doctor Voodoo" when he
replaced Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme during the Dark Reign
storyline. The character received his own eponymous ongoing series
written by Rick Remender, Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the
Supernatural, which was canceled after five issues.


Fictional character biography

Returning to his native Haiti (born in Port-au-Prince) after 12 years
(originally nearly 20) of education and practice as an accredited
psychologist in the United States, Jericho Drumm discovers that his twin
brother, Daniel Drumm, the local houngan, is dying, a victim of a
voodoo sorcerer who claims to be possessed by the spirit of the
serpent-god Damballah. Just before he dies, Daniel makes his brother vow
to visit Daniel's mentor, Papa Jambo. Jericho does, and becomes Jambo's
student. After studying under the aged houngan for several weeks,
Jericho gains a greater mastery of voodoo practices than his own
brother, becoming a houngan in his own right. Papa Jambo then performs a
rite that summons Daniel's spirit from the dead and joins it with
Jericho's own. Having fashioned a worthy successor, Papa Jambo dies.

Taking the name "Brother Voodoo", Jericho challenges the priest, who
goes by the same name as his god Damballah, and his cult. With the help
of his brother Daniel Drumm's spirit possessing one of the cult members,
Jericho removes Damballah's artifact of power (wangal), causing
Damballah's snakes to turn on him and evidently destroying Damballah's
cult. Brother Voodoo becomes Haiti's houngan supreme and champion, and
establishes a sprawling mansion as a base of operations. He places the
wangal in a safe, its combination known only to Brother Voodoo and his
manservant Bambu.

Brother Voodoo encounters the scientist Baron Samedi and artificial
zombies created by the terrorist-scientist group A.I.M.; the original
Black Talon, Mama Limbo, and the Dark Lord Cult; and the houngan
Dramabu. Having established himself, Brother Voodoo goes on to help
other superheroes, including Spider-Man and Moon Knight, as well
as the Jack Russell werewolf.

[Doctor Voodoo as the Sorcerer Supreme in The New Avengers #53 (July
2009). Art by Billy Tan and Matt Banning.] Brother Voodoo eventually
succumbs to the lure of power that Damballah's wangal represented. Upon
Jericho's wearing it, the god Damballah takes over Daniel's soul, burns
down the mansion and apparently slays Bambu. He travels to New York City
to attempt to take over the mind and body of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme,
Doctor Strange, who eventually frees Brother Voodoo of Damballah's
influence and re-confines the evil god to the wangal. He later
becomes involved with the supernatural 'Howling Commandos" operation of
the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and registers with the
government in accordance with the Superhuman Registration Act.

While Black Panther was fighting Erik Killmonger, Brother Voodoo
revealed himself to be a Skrull when he attempted to kill Cannibal, whom
he deemed to be a threat. However, the two killed each other in the
struggle, and the discovery of 'Brother Voodoo's' true form revealed the
Skrull invasion to Black Panther, allowing him time to prepare. Like
other heroes replaced by the Skrulls, Brother Voodoo was revealed to be
alive at the end of Secret Invasion.

Sorcerer Supreme and apparent death

The Eye of Agamotto leaves Doctor Strange after showing him and the New
Avengers nearly thirty candidates who would possibly replace Strange.
Because he comes into possession of the Eye, Drumm becomes the new
Sorcerer Supreme.

Aided by the New Avengers, he eventually battles the entity Agamotto
itself to prevent Agamotto from retrieving the eye and gaining the power
to rule Earth's dimension, and appears to sacrifice himself in an
explosion he engineers to destroy both Agamotto and the Eye.

Return

During the AXIS storyline, Doctor Doom makes a Faustian deal to
resurrect Brother Voodoo, reasoning that he and Daniel are the only ones
who can stop the inverted Scarlet Witch from destroying Latveria.
The spirit of Daniel Drumm subsequently possesses Wanda so that she can
be used to undo the spell that inverted the heroes and villains.


Powers and abilities

Brother Voodoo possesses numerous mystical and quasi-physical powers
derived from the Loa, the spirit-gods of voodoo. He can easily enter
into a trance-like state in which he does not feel the heat from fire
and his skin becomes impervious to burning. He can also control flame
and lower life forms. Brother Voodoo can mystically create smoke
accompanied by the sound of drums. The smoke conceals his presence while
he is able to see through it. He has the ability to command certain
living things by a mystic sort of hypnotism, most effective over animals
and plants. He can summon the Loa to request transport for himself and
others instantaneously if they deem it necessary to his mission.

Brother Voodoo can also summon the spirit of his brother Daniel Drumm
from within his body, doubling his own strength. He can send the spirit
to possess another person's body and then has total control over their
actions.

Brother Voodoo also has more mundane escapist talents, once entering
Strange's building, not through magic, but through the chimney. He has
extensive knowledge of voudoun (voodoo) thanks to training by Papa
Jambo, as well as conventional medicine and psychology with a Ph.D. in
psychology.

He wears a mystic medallion that serves as a focus of his powers and as
a focus for his contact with his personal loas. He has, at times,
employed conventional firearms.

Brother Voodoo's appointment as the new Sorcerer Supreme has bestowed
upon him not only the power of the Eye of Agamotto, but also the Cloak
of Levitation and the Books of Knowledge, which were formerly in the
possession of Doctor Strange.


Other versions

Avengers of the Undead

An alternate version of Brother Voodoo appears as the leader of the
Avengers of the Undead, the team of Avengers from Earth-666. He first
appears when the mainstream version of Captain Britain entrusts the team
with the Orb of Necromancy, a powerful artifact that he wishes to keep
hidden. When Captain Britain and Hawkeye attempt to reclaim the Orb, the
Avengers of the Undead double-cross the heroes and attempt to kill
them.

Beavis and Butt-Head

Brother Voodoo was referenced in the Beavis and Butt-Head comic book
(also published by ) in issue #15, summer 1995. The comic
depicts Brother Voodoo arriving to the sound of beating drums, calling
out, "Dumballah, I am coming for you!", prompting Butt-Head to ask, "Who
the HELL is this WUSS?". Beavis identifies him incorrectly as "Brother
DooDoo" despite Dumballah actually referring to the Brother by his
proper name on the same page. Brother Voodoo wrestles with a snake,
dispatches it, and finally threatens Dumballah with the promise,
"...You're next!".

Fred Hembeck

Cartoonist Fred Hembeck regularly featured the Brother Voodoo character
in the cartoons he drew each month in  Age, (1983) beginning
with issue #14 (May 1984) generally depicting him as a lame character
constantly trying (and failing) to get his own series. Hembeck also
introduced "Sister Voodoo" as his long-lost sister and "Voodoo Chile",
her child. When Brother Voodoo finally got his own solo story in 
Super-Heroes vol. 2 #1, (May 1990) Hembeck drew it in a serious art
style very different from his cartooning.

In his cartoon in the final issue of  Age, #140 (September 1994)
Hembeck claimed he had only begun mocking Brother Voodoo because he had
the character confused with an "even lamer" Silver Age character, 
Comics' Brother Power the Geek #1-2 (October & December 1968).

 Zombies

In Ultimate Fantastic Four #23 (Nov. 2005), Brother Voodoo is one of
dozens of superhero zombies. In the one-shot, flashback comic book
 Zombies: Dead Days (July 2007), Brother Voodoo is one of the
last few surviving heroes to become infected with the zombie virus.

Supernaturals

The four-issue, weekly miniseries Supernaturals (Oct. 1998), written
by Brian Pulido, featured an alternate-universe Brother Voodoo leading a
team composed of Ghost Rider, Werewolf by Night, the Gargoyle, the Black
Cat and Satana, to fight a mystically powered version of the villain
Jack O'Lantern in a world where only magical heroes and villains
existed.

What If? Age of Apocalypse

Brother Voodoo was one of the main characters in an alternate Age of
Apocalypse, first seen in the February 2007 What If? Featuring X-Men:
Age of Apocalypse one-shot. In this issue, Voodoo replaces Doctor
Strange as the Sorcerer Supreme in the story and wears Strange's
wardrobe. He battles Dormammu and helps the heroes take down Apocalypse,
though Jericho himself vanishes when the Eye of Agamotto is taken away
from him.
