CABLE (NATHAN SUMMERS) is a fictional character appearing in American
comic books published by , most commonly in association
with X-Force and the X-Men. Nathan Summers is the adult son of the X-Man
Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Madelyne Pryor (Jean Grey's clone), and the
half brother of Rachel Summers, from a possible future timeline, having
been transported as an infant to the future, where he grew into a
warrior, before returning to the present. The character first appeared
as a newborn infant in Uncanny X-Men #201 (Jan. 1986), created by
writer Chris Claremont, while Cable's adult identity was created by
writer Louise Simonson and artist/co-writer Rob Liefeld, and first
appeared in The New Mutants #87 (March 1990).


Publication history

Creation

[The New Mutants #87 (March 1990). Art by Rob Liefeld and Todd
McFarlane.] The character's first appearance was in The New Mutants
#86 (Feb. 1990). He does not appear anywhere in the issue's story, but
the "next issue" teaser includes a small drawing of the character. This
was followed by a full appearance in The New Mutants #87 (March 1990).
Though the artist Rob Liefeld is responsible for his visual design,
name, and much of his personality, it is claimed that Cable also got
some inspiration from editor Bob Harras. Liefeld explains the
creation of the character:

New Mutants and X-Force

Cable is first seen in conflict with Stryfe's Mutant Liberation
Front, the United States government, and Freedom Force. The New
Mutants intervened and he asked for their help against the Mutant
Liberation Front. Cable saw them as potential soldiers in his war
against Stryfe. He became their new teacher and leader, and outfitted
them. He came into conflict with Wolverine, noting that the two
had an old feud between them. Cable and the New Mutants teamed up with
Wolverine and Sunfire against the MLF. Cable also led the New Mutants
against the Genoshans.

With the aid of Domino, Cable reorganized the New Mutants into
X-Force. The New Mutants ended with issue #100, with Cable and
other characters then appearing the following month in X-Force #1.
The X-Force series provided further detail for the character's back
story revealing that he was from the future and that he had traveled to
the past with the aim of stopping Stryfe's plans as well as preventing
Apocalypse's rise to power. Cable traveled between the 1990s and his
future with his ship Graymalkin, which contained a sentient computer
program called Professor, the future version of the program built into
X-Factor's Ship.

In 1992, the character had a two issue miniseries, titled Cable: Blood
and Metal, written by Fabian Nicieza, pencilled by John Romita, Jr.,
and inked by Dan Green, published in October and November of that year.
The series explored Cable and the villain Stryfe's ongoing battle with
one another, and its effect on the people that surround Cable.

Cable (vol. 1) and Soldier X

Shortly after Blood and Metal, Cable was given his own ongoing series
titled CABLE. Issue #6 (Dec. 1993) confirmed the character to be
Nathan Christopher Summers, the son of Cyclops (Scott Summers) and
Madelyne Pryor (Jean Grey's clone) who had been taken to the future in
X-Factor #68 (July 1991), introduced by writer Chris Claremont, and
appeared in Uncanny X-Men #201 (Jan. 1986). The series ran for 107
issues from May 1993 until September 2002 before being relaunched as
SOLDIER X, which lasted 12 more issues until Aug. 2003. The book
initially had trouble finding a stable creative team. A writer/penciller
team would complete no more than three issues in a row until Jeph Loeb
and Ian Churchill began work on issue #20 and finish on #35. Loeb and
Churchill provided the first instance of stability, working together on
fifteen of the twenty issues from #20–39. During their run, they
explored characters in Cable’s past, his feeling of responsibility
toward Nathan Grey, his relationship with Domino and Blaquesmith, and
further adventures with Kane, the Sugar Man, and the Microverse.

The 1994 miniseries The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix provided
further information on the character's back story. In the future, Mother
Askani, a time-displaced Rachel Summers, pulled the minds of Scott and
Jean into the future where, as "Slym" and "Redd", they raised Cable for
twelve years. During their time together, the "family" prevented
Apocalypse from transferring his essence into a new body, ending his
reign of terror. It is furthermore established that Mister Sinister
created Cyclops' son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier
Cable) to destroy Apocalypse.

Cable and Deadpool, Cable (vol. 2)

[The character's co-creator, Rob Liefeld, holding up a copy of New
Mutants #87, in which the character first appeared] After his solo
series ended, he was paired with the mercenary Deadpool in a new ongoing
series titled Cable & Deadpool. The series largely dealt with
Cable's efforts to change the world for the better, including turning
his old spaceship Greymalkin into the floating utopian island of
Providence. The first story arc of the series features a Cable that
has learned to suppress his techno-organic virus to a nearly effortless
degree, allowing him to access the better part of his vast psionic
powers. He gains a power level similar to his Nate Grey counterpart from
The Age of Apocalypse reality and tries to use them to force the people
of the world to live peacefully. Using his powers at this magnitude also
means that he will die due to the vast power being too much for his body
to continuously maintain. He tries to carry out his plans quickly,
defeating the X-Men, Six Pack and S.H.I.E.L.D. with little effort. They
turn the tide of the battle on Cable by enlisting the aid of the Silver
Surfer. Cable and the Silver Surfer battled, destroying buildings and
other structures but were immediately rebuilt by Cable's vast
telekinesis. All the while Cable tried to explain his good intentions to
the Surfer with no avail. Although Cable destroyed his board and briefly
held his own against the Surfer, he was ultimately defeated when the
Surfer destroyed Cable's arm. Eventually Cable recovered his psionic
powers which became stronger than ever due to the Silver Surfer's
radioactive beams. Around the same time period, Cable becomes a member
of a team of X-Men that consists of Rogue, Iceman, Cannonball,
Sabretooth, Mystique, Lady Mastermind, and Omega Sentinel. In
preparation for Messiah Complex, Cable seemingly died when he detonated
Providence remains to prevent Gambit and Sunfire from stealing his
database, causing the series to focus mostly on Deadpool for the next
six or so issues. This series was canceled at the fiftieth issue and was
replaced by two series starring each of the characters.

It is revealed that Cable survived, and has the mutant baby girl that
the X-Men, Marauders, and Purifiers have been seeking during the Messiah
Complex storyline. In 2008,  released Cable vol. 2, a
new ongoing series by Duane Swierczynski and artist Ariel Olivetti.
This new series directly follows the events of "Messiah Complex". The
series features Cable, and the messianic child's time traveling
adventures. The dangers of the future and pursuit by Bishop are balanced
with the humor of "Cable the soldier" becoming "Cable the Nanny."

It is revealed that Cable and the mutant messiah have taken refuge in
the future in the secluded safe haven of New Liberty. There, Cable gets
married to a resident, Hope, who later dies defending the child. Cable
decides to name her Hope, in honor of her deceased foster mother.

In 2009, Cable vol. 2 had a seven-issue crossover with X-Force,
X-Force/Cable: Messiah War, which is the second story in a three-part
storyline that began in X-Men: Messiah Complex.

After the events of the Messiah War, Hope and Cable are separated in
time, appearing in the same spot but in different years. When Cable
touches down from the spot, he appears two years after Hope, and is
steadily losing control of his body due to the techno-organic virus
within him. It alters his appearance so much that Hope doesn't register
Cable's face. Eventually, Bishop, using his codename as a way to portray
himself as a holy figure, gains on them, and Cable and Hope jettison
themselves into space in the last ship the planet had. Bishop, armed
with a thermonuclear device in the stump of his arm, states that he
knows how to make his own ship and it'll only be a matter of time.

Cable was canceled in April 2010 with issue #25 (the final issue being
called Deadpool and Cable #25).

In the 2010 storyline "Second Coming", Cable succumbs to the
techno-organic virus in his bloodstream while holding open a time-portal
that allowed other members of X-Force to escape from the future. The
death was shown in X-Force #28 written by Craig Kyle and Chris Yost,
who noted that, "For us, Cable was always a character whose death was
something the character himself would put forward — if that's what it
took to complete his mission, he wouldn't think twice about it."

Avengers: X-Sanction

On July 27, 2011,  announced at the San Diego Comic Con the return
of Cable. The new project, originally titled as "Cable Reborn", was
re-titled as Avengers: X-Sanction, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by
Ed McGuinness. The miniseries served as a lead-in to the Avengers vs.
X-Men storyline beginning in April 2012.

Having been teleported to the future during his last act, Cable learned
from his old mentor, Blaquesmith, that Hope will apparently die in some
future accident caused by the Avengers, prompting him to go back in time
and try to use his last 24 hours of life before the techno-organic virus
completely consumes his body to stop the Avengers before they can kill
Hope.

Although he manages to defeat Captain America, Falcon, and Iron Man, he
is caught off-guard when he is attacked by the Red Hulk, initially
assuming that the Red Hulk is "Talbot," a foe from the future, before
the Red Hulk informs him with grim satisfaction that he is actually
someone who Cable has never fought before. With the aid of
Blaquesmith – flashbacks revealing that they discovered various
anti-mutant technologies in the Avengers Mansion – Cable manages to
fight off the Red Hulk, partially infecting him with the techno-organic
virus, only to be interrupted by Hope and Cyclops, who both denounce his
actions as unnecessary, culminating in Wolverine and Spider-Man
attacking him as they vow to take back the Avengers. During the
fight with Wolverine, Spider-Man is taken out by Cyclops, and
Blaquesmith convinces Hope to counter Cable's moves by freeing the
Avengers, ripping out the bomb that Cable threatened would blow them up
while Red Hulk burned the techno-organic virus out of his system.

The Avengers then proceeded to fight Cable until he was nearly dead from
both the fight and the virus, and Cyclops asked to take his son home,
with Captain America insisting the Avengers keep the weapons and ship.
Back at Utopia, Blaquesmith helps Hope to realize that she can still
save Cable, and she begins to absorb the techno-organic virus before
fully manifesting the Phoenix Force raptor for the first time around
herself. When it vanishes, Cable is cured not only of the advanced
incursion of the virus, but apparently fully, as his left hand is shown
to be fully organic along with his left eye, but he remains in a
catatonic state. Afterwards, Cable and Cyclops speak telepathically,
with Cable informing his father that Hope is indeed the Phoenix and is
destined to save Earth from an unknown disaster. He goes on to say that
a war will come with the Avengers and that he needs Cyclops to protect
Hope. Cable promises to be there when he's needed in the future.

Cable and X-Force

Cable's next appearance was in a new series, Cable and X-Force by
writer Dennis Hopeless and artist Salvador Larroca. The series debuted
in December 2012 and features Cable and a new fugitive team,
unofficially referred to by the  Universe media as the new
"X-Force".<ref name="Cable&X-Force"> This version of X-Force initially
consists of Cable, Colossus, Doctor Nemesis, Domino, and Forge. This
series focuses on eliminating disasters based on mysterious visions that
Cable is receiving, resorting to occasionally more brutal methods than
the prime X-teams would use.

X-Force

Continuing from Cable and X-Force it features a team of Cable,
Psylocke, Fantomex and Marrow, written by X-Men: Legacy writer Simon
Spurrier. Where Cable's daughter Hope Summers is infected with the same
techno-virus that Cable was infected with at the beginning of Cable and
X-Force.


Characterization

According to Duane Swierczynski, although the writer "missed Cable's
heyday in the early 1990s," Cable is "[his] kind of antihero—the
cryptic, Man with No Name of mutantkind. If [Swierczynski had] quibbles
with the Cable of yesteryear, it's that he was just a tad too
powerful. [Cable] could port around the world at will, fetch beer from
the fridge with the power of his mind, and then crush said beer can
against his metallic love handle." When asked whether Nathan Summers
was a tragic character in his mind, Swierczynski replied that, "Cable's
still a bad ass soldier, make no mistake. But [the mission to protect
Hope Summers in X-Men: Messiah War] is breaking him down like he's
never been broken down before" and said that "[the readers are] going to
see Cable struggling with a new bodily problem, one directly borne out
of his experiences in 'Messiah War.'"


Powers and abilities

Cable was born with telepathic and telekinetic abilities. However, the
extent to which he has been able to utilize these powers has varied
dramatically throughout his appearances. Originally, both were limited
by his need to restrain his techno-organic infection, and his powers
were negligible compared to his more traditional fighting skills.
However, following the subsidence of the infection, they gradually
increased to the point where they were similar in magnitude to those of
Nate Grey, to whom he is genetically identical. At their height, he
demonstrated the ability to simultaneously levitate the floating city of
Providence and combat the Silver Surfer. Following that story, his
powers were burnt out and he replaced both with technological
substitutes. He later states that both his telepathy and telekinesis
have faded to nothing.

When Professor Xavier's son Legion travels back in time to kill Magneto
in the "Legion Quest" storyline, Beast notes that Cable possesses
"latent time-travel abilities". With the assistance of Shi'ar
technology, Professor Xavier "jump-starts" this ability while Jean Grey
telekinetically holds Cable's body together, allowing Cable to send his
consciousness into the past.

In the Messiah War storyline, during the fight with his clone, Stryfe,
Cable demonstrates the ability to hide others from Stryfe's mental view,
implying that at least he retains some of his telepathic powers. He also
still possesses some of his telekinesis, but he is using it solely to
keep the techno-organic virus in his body at bay.

His techno-organic body parts possess enhanced strength and durability,
and his techno-organic left eye gives him enhanced eyesight, allowing
him to see farther than a normal human and in the infrared spectrum. He
is also able to interface his techno-organic body parts with machinery,
using them to hack into computers, open electronic locks, and travel
through time.

As of the end of Avengers: X-Sanction, Cable has apparently been fully
cured of the techno-organic virus by the Phoenix Force (via Hope
Summers), and appears to at least have his telepathy. As a result,
his cybernetic eye and arm have been restored to flesh and blood,
although almost nonfunctional and atrophied, forcing Cable to wear an
eyepatch and use an enhanced brace, made by Forge and laden with special
weaponry.

In Deadpool & Cable: Split Second, Cable had once again lost his
powers, but regained them along with his cybernetics as a result of
Deadpool repairing his personal timeline.

Cable also made use of a spear-like weapon called the Psi-Mitar, which
was originally a long staff with a spear point on one end and a scythe
blade on the other, used primarily by the Askani. It functions as a
focus and amplifier for telepathic or telekinetic power, which it can
project as power blasts.


Other versions

In addition to his mainstream  Universe incarnation, Cable has had
been depicted in other fictional universes.

In the Cable and Deadpool series storyline "Enema of State",
Deadpool and the mutants Cannonball and Siryn discover several alternate
versions of Cable as they traverse several alternate universes via
"Bodyslide", searching for Cable after he disappears. They remain in
each separate universe for only a brief time, while Deadpool searches
for the Cable from "his" timeline/universe. They first encounter an evil
incarnation of Cable who has become one of the four Horsemen of
Apocalypse, War. Other versions include a guru-type Cable known as
"Brother Nathan", on whose alternate earth ll violence had been
abolished, a Phalanx-Cable, consumed by the techno-organic virus
within his body, and the Cable of the "House of M" reality, an
infant in the care of a subdued Mister Sinister on a quiet Nebraska
farm, which Deadpool eventually realizes was his Cable. Deadpool
seized the infant, took him back to his home universe, and cared for
Nathan, who grew rapidly after having been injected with Deadpool's
DNA.

Cable appears in  Zombies 2. Cable is uninfected, forced to work
for the Acolytes in order for him to forever end the zombie virus. With
the help of Forge, he constructs new artificial limbs for the Black
Panther, after the zombie Henry Pym consumes the original ones.

In the setting of the Earth X storyline, the Techno-organic virus has
overtaken Cable's body, who has become a blob of organic metal.

In the Deadpool Pulp timeline, Cable is now GENERAL CABLE, who, along
with Stryfe (also a General) and J. Edgar Hoover, hires former CIA man
Wade Wilson to get back a stolen nuclear briefcase.

In the fantasy world depicted in the graphic novel Wolverine: Rahne of
Terra, Cable's counterpart is a wizard called the Mage, who carried the
Warlock Staff and a crossbow.

In Ultimate X-Men, Cable is a future version of Wolverine who goes
back to the past to capture Professor Xavier, returning with him to the
future in order to train him for the coming battle with Apocalypse.
After Apocalypse's death, Cable fades out of existence.

A two-part storyline in What If..._ asks, "What If Cable Destroyed the
X-Men?" In this story, Cable clashes with Professor X and the X-Men over
their beliefs and differences in methods. Ultimately, Cable leads a
faction of mutants loyal to him and assassinates the Professor, Cyclops,
and Jean Grey before embarking on a violent crusade. Cable is ultimately
killed by Wolverine, but his actions have already led to the further
oppression of mutants. Magneto attempts to take control of America in
the chaos, but is killed by a new model of plastic Sentinels, who decide
that enslaving humanity is the best way to root out mutants. However,
Wolverine assembles several surviving mutants to fight against the
Sentinels as a new team of X-Men.

X-Men Forever is an alternate universe written by Chris Claremont that
takes place after the events of X-Men vol. 2, #3. In it, it is
revealed that X-Factor's confrontation with Apocalypse ended differently
— Nathan was saved, but aged somehow from a toddler into a child.
Nathan lives with his great-grandmother and grandfather in Alaska. An
attack by mysterious agents causes Nathan to be moved to the protective
custody of the Starjammers. He is shown to possess telepathic
powers. Cable appears in one panel of the series but no connection
between Cable and Nathan is made.


In other media

Television

Cable made six appearances in X-Men: The Animated Series in the
episodes "Slave Island", "The Cure", "Time Fugitives" and "Beyond Good
and Evil" voiced by Lawrence Bayne in the English version and by Tesshō
Genda in the Japanese dub. This version of Cable possessed his trademark
metal arm but it is said to be a bionic construct rather than a result
of the techno-organic virus. He is never shown to be telepathic, though
he does use telekinesis in one episode. He is also depicted as coming
from the year 3999, where he leads an army in a desperate war against
the forces of the immortal villain Apocalypse. It is shown there is some
connection between Cable, Jean Grey, and Cyclops; Jean Grey scans
Cable's mind in one episode and detects images of herself and Cyclops.
She remarks to Scott, ''"He's more important to the future...to our
future, than you can imagine."'' In the episode "Time Fugitives" shows
Cable using a sentient computer, similar to the Professor from the
comics. In the episode "Beyond Good and Evil," he uses a time machine
named Graymalkin to travel back in time to destroy Apocalypse.

Influence

Artist Alex Ross drew upon his dislike of Liefeld's design of Cable when
Ross designed the character Magog for the 1996 miniseries Kingdom
Come. Following writer Mark Waid's instructions that the character's
appearance be based on aspects of superhero design trends of the time
that they disliked, Ross said of Cable, "That's a character that Mark
Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most
God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing
from was – really only two key designs of Rob's – the design of Cable. I
hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on
the character – the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and
what's with all the guns? But the thing is, when I put those elements
together with the helmet of Shatterstar – I think that was his name –
well, the ram horns and the gold, suddenly it held together as one of
the designs that I felt happiest with in the entire series."


Awards

Cable #34–35 were part of the "Onslaught" storyline, which was a top
vote getter for the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite
Comic-Book Story for 1997.
