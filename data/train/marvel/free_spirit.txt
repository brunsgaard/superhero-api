Fictional character biography

As a graduate student Cathy Webster participates in an unsanctioned
psychology experiment involving subliminal recordings. She is
subliminally programmed to hate all men, and her body is subjected to
"mutagenic radiation". The radiation enhances her body to peak human
conditioning similar to Captain America. Cathy eventually overcomes her
brainwashing and discovers the woman in charge of the experiment, a
criminal scientist named Superia. She also crosses paths with the
criminal Baron Zemo and the morally ambiguous Diamondback. Captain
America takes Cathy and another hero, Jack Flag under his wing and
trains them both. The duo also inherits Captain America's network of
computer operatives called the "Captain America Hotline" when he
temporarily loses his powers due to the breakdown of the Super Soldier
Serum in his bloodstream.

The Initiative

Cathy is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the Initiative
program, according to Civil War: Battle Damage Report.


Powers and abilities

Like Captain America, Cathy has been augmented to peak human
conditioning. She has reached a high level of martial prowess, including
basic acrobatics and street fighting techniques, from training sessions
with Captain America and Jack Flag.
