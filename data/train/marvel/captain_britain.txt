CAPTAIN BRITAIN (BRIAN BRADDOCK) is a fictional character appearing in
American comic books published by . Created by Chris
Claremont and Herb Trimpe, he first appeared in Captain Britain Weekly
#1 (October 1976). The character has been used in stories through the
years by many people, most notably Chris Claremont, Alan Davis, and Alan
Moore.

The character was initially intended to be a British equivalent of
Captain America. Endowed with extraordinary powers by the legendary
magician Merlyn and his daughter Roma, Captain Britain was assigned to
uphold the laws of Britain.


Publication history

The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Herb
Trimpe and originally appeared in Captain Britain Weekly, an
anthology comic published exclusively in the United Kingdom by the
 imprint known as  UK. (Captain Britain Weekly also
included reprinted material featuring other  characters
such as Nick Fury and the Fantastic Four). The first few issues of the
comic were also promoted with free gifts, including a cardboard Captain
Britain mask and a Captain Britain boomerang.

Chris Claremont left the series after just ten issues, midway through
the "Doctor Synne" storyline, and has since stated that this was because
his view of the character and series was very different from that of the
editor. In 1978, though, Chris Claremont revisited the character and
introduced him to an international audience, fully integrating him into
the  Universe via a story that starred Captain Britain and
Spider-Man in 's long-running  Team-Up series.

The  Team-Up story was reprinted in the UK in Super Spider-Man
& Captain Britain which is where the Captain's adventures continued
after Captain Britain Weekly folded in July 1977, after running for 39
issues. The serialization of the Spider-Man team-up marked the end of
Captain Britain's exploits until March 1979 when Captain Britain
appeared with the Black Knight in the "Otherworld Saga" which ran in
Hulk Comic.

Captain Britain appeared as one of the characters in  US's 1982
Contest of Champions limited series, which featured a collection of
international heroes. While the character had appeared almost
exclusively in 's UK comics, some established  characters
such as Captain America and the Black Knight appeared, but prior to
Contest of Champions, which was set during the period of the
"Otherworld Saga", 's American comics had not referenced these
stories or acknowledged that they were part of the same shared 
Universe.

Following the "Otherworld Saga" the character was relaunched, in a
redesigned costume, in the  Superheroes anthology title. The
relaunch was initially written by Dave Thorpe and illustrated by Alan
Davis, but after a few issues Dave Thorpe left the series and was
replaced by British writer Alan Moore, who used Thorpe's stories as a
springboard for the "Jaspers' Warp" storyline.

On redesigning the costume of the character, Davis noted that his
depiction of Brian Braddock was visually based on Garth, "an exaggerated
Greek god, perfect in every way" and that:

During this run, the series moved from  Superheroes into a
new monthly comic, The Daredevils. When The Daredevils was canceled
after eleven issues Captain Britain was continued in The Mighty World
of  - and then, after the end of the run of Alan Moore,
who left because of a dispute over unpaid invoices, it continued for
a few more issues with different writers (Steve Craddock, Alan Davis,
and Mike Collins) until the comics ended  and the story moved to a
new monthly Captain Britain title with Jamie Delano taking over
writing duties on the recommendation of Moore and with the agreement
of Davis.

Following the cancellation of Captain Britain's solo series, Claremont
and Davis launched the American monthly Excalibur in 1988, featuring
an eponymous team which included Captain Britain, with Braddock as a
core member.

New Excalibur_ was introduced in 2005, with Captain Britain as team
leader. This series ran until issue #24 and the team was disbanded in
the X-Men: Die by the Sword limited series.

A new series was then started in 2008, using the Secret Invasion
crossover storyline as a launchpad. Captain Britain headlines this
series, Captain Britain and MI: 13, written by Paul Cornell, which
included some characters from New Excalibur, as well as members of MI:
13 who appeared in Cornell's Wisdom limited series.

Panini Comics bought  UK and in 2006 renewed and broadened their
license with  which allows them to produce original comic
stories for the British and European markets. This has included Captain
Britain's first original appearance in UK comics in thirteen years, with
a story that ran in Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures and
Panini plan to have more in their new all-ages title 
Heroes.

Captain Britain made several cameo appearances in 
publications then would feature in a Heroic Age tie in anthology limited
series and a Deadpool Team Up issue.

Captain Britain appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 Secret
Avengers series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue
#37 (March 2013).

Beginning in November 2014, Captain Britain will reappear with the
Avengers as a part of the Time Runs Out storyline.


Fictional character biography

Origins

[Captain Britain (vol. 1) #36 (1977).
Art by Pablo Marcos.] Born and raised in the small town of Maldon, Essex
and educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh, Brian was a shy and
studious youth, living a relatively quiet life and spending a lot of
time with his parents and siblings (older brother Jamie and fraternal
twin Elizabeth). The family was an aristocratic one that was no longer
rich enough to fraternise with their former academic peers, leaving
Brian (too proud to fraternise with lower classes) a lonely child who
immersed himself in the study of physics.

After the death of his parents (Sir James and Lady Elizabeth) in what
seemed to be a laboratory accident, Brian takes a fellowship at Darkmoor
nuclear research centre. When the facility is attacked by the
technological criminal Joshua Stragg (alias "The Reaver"), Brian tries
to find help by escaping on his motorcycle. Although he crashes his bike
in a nearly fatal accident, Merlyn and his daughter, the Omniversal
Guardian, Roma appear to the badly injured Brian. They give him the
chance to be the superhero Captain Britain. He is offered a choice: the
Amulet of Right or the Sword of Might. Considering himself to be no
warrior and unsuited for the challenge, he rejects the Sword and chooses
the Amulet. This choice transforms Brian Braddock into Captain
Britain.

It is later revealed that Braddock is only one member of a much larger,
inter-dimensional corps of mystical protectors. Every Earth in 
Comics' Multiverse has its own Captain Britain who is expected to defend
that version of Britain and uphold its local laws. They are collectively
called the Captain Britain Corps. Captain Britain protects "Earth-616"
of the  Universe. Later still, it was retconned that Brian's
father, Sir James Braddock, was himself from Otherworld and a member of
an earlier Corps; Merlyn had sent him to Earth-616 to take a carefully
chosen mate and father a hero who would be far greater even than he
(other comics still have the Braddock family as old and established:
they've been in the Hellfire Club for generations and Braddock Manor is
a "quarter millennium" old in its first appearance).

Early career as Captain Britain

As his career as a superhero begins, Brian fights as the champion of
Great Britain, often clashing with S.T.R.I.K.E. and Welsh anti-superhero
police officer Dai Thomas, and would develop a rogues gallery including
the assassin Slaymaster and the crime matriarch Vixen. He tried to keep
his studies going and court fellow student Courtney Ross while also
working as a superhero, and (as with other  heroes) was viewed as
a coward by others because he always vanished whenever trouble
started.

During one episode, his siblings Betsy and Jamie became aware of his
secret identity after he saved them from Dr Synne, a villain terrorising
the land around Braddock Manor. Synne turned out to be the patsy of the
sentient computer Mastermind, a device Brian's father had created; it
was then Brian learned that his parents did not die in an accident but
had been deliberately killed by the machine.

Brian's greatest achievement in this time was preventing a neo-Nazi
takeover of the country with the aid of Captain America, Nick Fury, and
S.T.R.I.K.E. commander Lance Hunter. He was responsible for both
saving Prime Minister Jim Callaghan from the Red Skull and from stopping
the Skull's germ bomb from killing London. The Nazis' first strike
had actually happened during the battle with Mastermind, when the Red
Skull took the plans for the computer and had Braddock Manor bombed to
rubble (a later retcon said Mastermind had created a hologram that was
bombed instead); Captain Britain was briefly believed dead and an empty
coffin laid in state at St Paul's Cathedral.

As time goes on, Brian begins fighting more supernatural enemies rather
than regular supervillains: this was part of Merlin's overall plan to
mentally prepare him for Jasper's Warp.

Soon afterwards, Brian travels to America to study. By a strange twist
of fate, he rooms with Peter Parker (the hero Spider-Man) at Empire
State University. A brief misunderstanding caused Brian to battle
Spider-Man, before the two of them were captured by the assassin Arcade.
They then tackled various challenges in Murderworld, rescued Brian's
love interest Courtney who was kidnapped and placed in a sealed cocoon
with limited air, and became the first victims to survive
Murderworld. Near the end of this stay, homesickness and stress saw
him drink heavily. He stopped after, when drunk and embarrassed by a
defeat, he beat a supervillain so badly she was put in hospital;
ashamed, Brian paid for her hospital bills and therapy.

On a flight home from America, he came under mental attack by the
demonic Necromon, causing Brian to leap out of the plane; he spent two
years as a hermit on the Cornish coast, repairing his psyche. He was
eventually called to Merlyn's service again, fighting alongside the
Black Knight and the elf Jackdaw to defend Otherworld from Necromon.
With his memories partially restored Brian and the Knight, allied with
Vortigen the Proud Walker, battled Mordred the Evil. Both the Black
Knight and Captain Britain were snatched out of time to join the
Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, where Captain Britain fought against
the Arabian Knight, but they were soon returned to resume their quest.
At the entrance to Otherworld Brian was slain by the spectral White
Rider, and his corpse claimed by Mandrac, Nethergod Lord of the Slain
and the Rider’s master, though Merlyn and the Knight swiftly recovered
it. Merlyn reunited Captain Britain’s departed spirit with his body,
resurrecting him. While the hero healed, Merlyn restored his remaining
memories and informed him of the Nethergod’s involvement with his early
foes. Now recalling Arthur’s location, the Black Knight, Captain Britain
and Jackdaw were sent to awaken the King. Succeeding in this quest,
Arthur then sent Brian and Jackdaw magically away through the
dimensions, stating Brian had a destiny to fulfill elsewhere. As a
reward, he and Jackdaw were sent back to Earth.

Jaspers' Warp

With Necromon defeated, Merlyn merges the powers of the Amulet of
Right and the Star Sceptre into a uniform to be worn by Braddock.
Captain Britain is sent with Jackdaw to Earth-238, a dictatorship run by
the British National Party, whose rule was enforced by the Status Crew,
where he works with the extra-dimensional Saturnyne to jump-start the
reality's development.

Braddock witnesses this Earth's descent into madness at the hands of Mad
Jim Jaspers, loses Jackdaw, and is murdered by the monstrous Fury before
being resurrected back on Earth-616. This turns out to have been a
deliberate plan by Merlyn to prepare him for the battle against the Jim
Jaspers of Earth-616, a far more powerful being. Merlyn, who had
previously resurrected Jackdaw, avoids doing so a second time to
increase his chances of successfully reviving Captain Britain.

Brian would find himself saving his sister Betsy and the former
Psi-Division of S.T.R.I.K.E. from his old enemy Slaymaster, drafted by
the mercenary group the Special Executive to save Saturnyne from a show
trial, during which he witnessed the destruction of Earth-238's reality
to prevent the Jaspers' Warp there from spreading out across the
multiverse, and encountered members of the pan-dimensional Captain
Britain Corps, an organisation of Captain Britains from various
dimensions. However, he and his assembled allies were unable to prevent
Earth-616's Jim Jaspers from expanding his influence over Earth, and
though Brian fought bravely it fell to the Fury to kill the villain -
Roma is of the opinion Merlyn intended all along for Brian to lead the
Fury to Earth-616 to do this, but this was unconfirmed.

Post-Warp

Following this and battles against conventional villains the Crazy Gang,
Slaymaster, and Vixen, Braddock was captured by Gatecrasher's
Technet on behalf of Sat-Yr-9, and then fought his interdimensional
counterpart Kaptain Briton. Brian is captured by Modred the Mystic,
and teams with Captain America to defeat Modred. He also got caught
up in the affairs of intelligence agency R.C.X., the British
government's replacement for S.T.R.I.K.E. He also met his future lover
Meggan.

Substituted

Due to the pressures put on him after the Warp, Braddock travels abroad
for a while. R.C.X. recruits his sister Betsy to become Captain
Britain while he is overseas, angering Brian enough to make him quit
when he learns this upon his return. She manages in the role for a
while, but unfortunately she proves no match for Slaymaster, who tears
out her eyes. Aware of his twin's pain through their telepathic bond,
Brian rushes back to fight Slaymaster, whom he eventually kills. After
this episode, Brian resumes the mantle of Captain Britain. In
real-world terms, these events took place over twelve pages across two
issues, though more than five months pass for the characters while Betsy
is Captain Britain. Their effect on Betsy, and her future with the
X-Men, was profound.

Drawing of the Sword

[Excalibur from left to right, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, Widget, Captain
Britain, Meggan, and Phoenix III.
Promotional art by Alan Davis.] When the X-Men appeared to perish in
Dallas (see Fall of the Mutants), a group of heroes including
Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, Phoenix III, and Meggan joined Brian to form
Excalibur - Great Britain's premier super-team - in an effort to
continue the work of the X-Men. Excalibur fought Gatecrasher's Technet
in their first meeting together.

Brian was soon reunited with Courtney Ross. He then first battled
the Juggernaut. He clashed with old foes Arcade, and the Crazy Gang,
and was caused to temporarily switch bodies with the Crazy Gang's
Tweedledope. Brian also encountered and fought his other-dimensional
Nazi counterpart Hauptmann Englande. With Excalibur, he battled
Arcade's "Loonies". With Excalibur, he battled Thor, believing Thor
to be Juggernaut due to Loki's magic. Brian then journeyed with Thor
into a dimension ruled by Juggernaut.

Knights of Pendragon

During this period,  UK launched a miniseries starring Captain
Britain. It presented a much darker and mature version of Braddock as a
part of the Arthurian myth than was found in Excalibur. In the first
volume, Braddock teamed with police inspector DAI THOMAS, a regular from
his old solo series, and journalist KATE MCCLELLAN. The three were
investigating a series of grisly murders that were finally revealed to
be the work of mythical creature the Green Knight, a key character in
Arthurian mythology. The series also implied a strong mystical
connection between Braddock and the knight Lancelot. The series was not
a huge seller, though it does retain a cult following.

Identity crises

Brian quits costumed adventuring for a time and concentrates on
research, building the Midnight Runner for Excalibur. Eventually, he and
Meggan become engaged. However, Brian, Meggan, and the rest of Excalibur
are soon captured by the R.C.X. and Brian is severely beaten while
resisting. Dying, broken and bloody, he is healed by Roma, who fixes the
arcane circuitry in his costume to match his body's frequencies. She
also removes the "blunder factor" she had secretly cast over him (a
curse she had cast ensuring that he would need the help of the entire
team until he saw the innate value in it). The evil members of R.C.X.
are cleared out in a joint effort by Excalibur and the members of an
internal mutiny.

Immediately afterward, Phoenix III reappears and Excalibur journeys into
the future to save the world from the Sentinels. On the way back, Brian
is lost in the time-stream. Eventually, his body parts start reappearing
in the same space as Rachel's - first his arms, then his chest - for
brief flickers. Eventually, a rift is opened in which Brian and Rachel
switch places. Rachel is flung to the far future to become the Mother
Askani and Brian returns home. He is flooded, however, with memories of
the far future and remains disconnected from the real world. He calls
himself "Britannic" for some time, but eventually re-acclimates himself
to his old life. It changes slightly, as Excalibur moves to Muir Island
and new members join the team. Brian has a prophetic vision concerning
the London Branch of the Hellfire Club's plan to take over the United
Kingdom. Brian infiltrates the Club by claiming his father's position as
Black Rook and, again with Excalibur's help, thwarts its efforts at
domination.

King of Otherworld

In a battle with the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, Brian expends all of
his power to stop a dimensional portal from opening. Having lost his
powers, he leaves the team for some time, but returns to fulfill his
dream of marrying Meggan. After the ceremony on Otherworld, the team
disbands and its members return to the United States.

Brian soon finds work at the Darkmoor research facility. During one of
his tests on the new blade and armor of his friend the Black Knight,
Widget appears with warriors who begin to attack on Roma's behalf. The
heroes (including Psylocke, who is also visiting England) drive the
attackers off, then follow them to Otherworld where they discover that
the Captain Britain Corps has been decimated. Together with the
survivors - Crusader X and Captain UK - Brian and his comrades attempt
to stop Roma from acquiring the Sword of Might. This, together with the
Amulet of Right, would have the ability to remake the cosmos. Brian
searches for the Sword but finds a computer-filled shrine in a cavern
built by his father. A hologram of James Braddock, Sr. explains to Brian
that he is the savior and rightful heir of Otherworld with the innate
right to wield Excalibur. The hologram re-activates Brian's powers and
as he draws the sword, a fiery cross (similar to the British flag)
appears as a mask on his face. Brian then confronts Roma, who is
revealed to be his father's sentient and insane computer Mastermind.
With the aid of the real Roma, Braddock defeats the powerful computer.
Roma then relinquishes control of Otherworld to Captain Britain. He and
Meggan remain in Otherworld as effective rulers of the multiverse.
Unbeknownst to Brian, the events leading up to his assumption of the
Otherworld were orchestrated by Kang the Conqueror, for reasons yet to
be revealed.

In the "Lionheart of Avalon" storyline in The Avengers, the sorceress
Morgan Le Fay captures Brian and Meggan. Le Fay hopes that by killing
Braddock and severing his mystical ties to the land, she will destroy
all of Great Britain. However, Brian appears to Kelsey Leigh, a British
mother who dies protecting both her children and Captain America from
the Wrecking Crew. Braddock offers her the choice between the Amulet and
the Sword and, feeling that she could better defend her children with a
weapon, she chooses the latter. Although she is changed into a new
Captain Britain, she remains cursed by the inability to ever reveal
herself to her children. Because he transfers his power to Kelsey, the
plan to destroy Britain fails.

New Excalibur

Returning to Otherworld, Braddock and Meggan become rulers of the realm.
However, Captain Britain is forced to come back to Earth to stop the
House of M reality-shift from destroying all dimensions. During this
time, his wife Meggan apparently sacrifices her life to close a rip in
time that would have destroyed all existence. This results in Brian
becoming active as Captain Britain again and the formation of a new
Excalibur, along with Peter Wisdom, Sage, Juggernaut, Dazzler, and
Nocturne. Captain Britain also believes his sister Psylocke to be dead,
unaware that she has joined the Exiles. [Cover art for Captain Britain
& The MI-13 #6.
Art by Bryan Hitch.] He also assisted Pete Wisdom and British
intelligence agency MI-13 in their battle against a Martian
invasion.

After the defeat of Albion by New Excalibur, Braddock is reunited with
his sister and the Exiles in the miniseries X-Men: Die by the Sword
before he is severely injured by Rouge-Mort.

Captain Britain and MI: 13

A new series, written by Paul Cornell and drawn by Leonard Kirk,
features Captain Britain, Pete Wisdom, and other British superheroes
working for MI: 13. The series opened with a Skrull
onslaught on Britain, part of the Secret Invasion crossover, that saw
every British hero drafted into MI:13.

After fighting Skrull forces in London, Brian was dispatched with Pete
Wisdom, John the Skrull, and Spitfire to the Siege Perilous (a gateway
to the Otherworld) to secure Avalon and thus the world's magic from
Skrull conquest. Brian is left uncomfortable by having to kill Skrulls
and being separated from the Corps, and simply desires to represent his
country (believing, despite Wisdom's statements to the contrary, that he
stopped doing so). When the Skrulls shot a missile at the Siege to
destroy Earth's access to magic, he attempted to divert it and was
killed in a vicious explosion  - every inhabitant of the United
Kingdom became instantly aware of his death.

Captain Britain was once again resurrected by Merlin in the center of
Britain, and after taking possession of the sword Excalibur, confronted
the Skrulls in London; his resurrected form is stated by Merlin to be no
longer plagued with doubts and a unified symbol of the United Kingdom,
"like their flag, one thing that contains many!". He has increased
powers and theoretically has no limits, but this is reliant on his level
of confidence - he can just as easily become weak and vulnerable.
While he has chosen to work with MI:13 and their superhero team, he has
stated that the superheroes will no longer kill.

In battle against Doctor Plokta, creator of the Mindless Ones, he was
temporarily trapped in Plokta's "Dream Corridor" - a magical construct
trapping you in your heart's desire - where he briefly believed he had
found Meggan again. He got free and defeated Plokta by forcing him into
his own Corrider (presented as a supremely powerful act), but was left
unaware that the real Meggan had tried to make contact and was now stuck
in Hell. Later, however, during a conflict with Dracula, Dr. Doom
gives Meggan to Dracula to use as a bargaining chip. After Captain
Britain and MI13 defeat Dracula, Meggan and Captain Britain are
reunited.

Avengers

During an international meeting between Steve Rogers and MI13, Captain
Britain was offered a job with the Avengers. Captain Britain accepted
despite mixed reactions from his MI13 teammates.

He then disappeared from view to fight a war in Otherworld against the
demonic Goat, who was attempted to subjugate the multiverse. His brother
Jamie, now cured of madness, was a key ally and Brian tried to cajole
Psylocke into joining as well. Relations with his sister deteriorated as
the Corps tried to put her teammate Fantomex on trial for murdering a
child Apocalypse, arguing that it was still a crime to kill a child for
what they may become. Ironically, in the end it turned out the Goat was
a future version of Jamie who had been turned evil and Betsy, who had
been forced to sacrifice her emotions to win in battle, stopped the
villain by killing the contemporary Jamie; she then berated Brian for
leaving the choice to her. He was left bitter by the loss and
estranged from his sister.

Later, he becomes one of the new members of the Secret Avengers. He
left when the team disbanded after a battle with a race of robotic
beings known as the Descendants. Relations were salvaged with Betsy
after X-Force was disbanded and she admitted he had been right to try to
convict Fantomex for murder, while he admitted that it had been a
testament to character that Fantomex had ever been able to fight off his
murderous Sentinel urges.

He is later seen as the head of the Braddock Academy (the British answer
to the Avengers Academy), running it alongside Meggan, Spitfire, Union
Jack, and Elsa Bloodstone. One of the students is a young alternate
version of himself, KID BRITON.

Revolutionary War

At an unspecified time, Captain Britain and an army of British heroes
defeated Mys-Tech in battle; the agency came close to sending all of
Britain to hell in order to pay off their debts to Mephisto. Following
the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. was secretly called in to clean up the remains
of Mys-Tech's bases and technology as MI-13 didn't have the resources to
do it. Brian was made a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s European Division.
Years later, Pete Wisdom learned about this and sarcastically remarked
he was proud that Brian was acting like him.

Brian, MI-13, and S.H.I.E.L.D. began investigating a suspected return of
Mys-Tech but he was swiftly beaten down and captured by Death's Head II.
This was actually a ruse by Death's Head II to plant a tracking device
and find out why the Psycho-Wraiths wanted the captain (he didn't bother
to tell Brian). The Prime Wraith wanted the hero to be part of six
living batteries for a monotrace core, opening a portal to Hell for
Mephisto's armies (led by the brainwashed hero Killpower) to ravage the
Earth. Captain Britain was freed and fought to hold back the demons,
and tried to find a solution other than killing Killpower. "We're
heroes, we don't [kill]--" was all he could say before Killpower was
gunned down by the anti-heroes Major Hauer, Death's Head, and Colonel
Liger. Afterwards, on a whim Captain Britain placed a union flag on top
of a damaged Big Ben, deciding that surviving the battle gave them "the
right to celebrate a little" 

Time Runs Out

Eight months later during the Time Runs Out storyline, it is revealed
that the Multiverse is suffering from violent incursions between
parallel Earths. Captain Britain is seen as a new member of the
Illuminati. He is shown to be missing one of his eyes and states
that he is the last surviving member of the Captain Britain Corps with
the other members having all perished due to the collapse of the
Multiverse.


Powers and abilities

Originally, Captain Britain's powers were linked to the mystical Amulet
of Right, worn around his neck. When Brian Braddock rubbed the amulet
he was transformed from an ordinary mortal into a superhero version of
himself, complete with a more muscular physique. The amulet could also
mystically replenish his superhuman energies. He also possessed a
telescoping staff to vault. This also had other functions, the most
heavily relied upon being the ability to project a force field. Later,
Merlyn changed the staff into the mace-like Star Sceptre, which he
could utilize like a quarterstaff and which also gave him the ability of
flight. Merlyn changed his costume just before he entered the
alternate Earth-238, fusing the powers of the Amulet and the Scepter
into the new uniform and then later put these powers within Brian
himself when he was forced to rebuild Brian following Brian's death at
the hands of the Fury, making the suit a regulatory device for his
powers. Eventually, Brian no longer required even the battle-suit
for the full use of his powers, as his heritage of being the son of a
denizen of the extra-dimensional Otherworld became enough to power
him.

Brian Braddock has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability,
reflexes, senses, and the ability to fly at supersonic speeds. He also
possesses enhanced perceptions that allow him to be aware of things
others may miss (such as objects cloaked by spells of illusion).
When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma's
prompting, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the
UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers
anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times. His costume
acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers
wherever he goes.

However, the conditions of his power were once again changed during his
death and resurrection in the first story arc of Captain Britain and
MI: 13 as explained by writer Paul Cornell,

Brian is the fraternal twin of Betsy Braddock, a telepath, resulting in
a strong psychic bond between the two. As described by writer Chris
Claremont in the Uncanny X-Men House of M storyline, the two are in
fact immune to each other's powers because of their genetic
connection.

In addition, Braddock is a brilliant scientist with a Ph.D. in physics.


Other versions

CAPTAIN BRITAIN has been represented in various incarnations, not
exclusive to Brian Braddock. In addition to other characters who have
assumed the mantle of Captain Britain in the absence of Braddock, there
have been several other versions of characters written to have
originated from alternate universes.

Mainstream depictions

-   BRIAN BRADDOCK - becomes Captain Britain, after Merlyn gives him the
    Amulet of Right.
-   ELIZABETH "BETSY" BRADDOCK - assumes the mantle of Captain Britain
    while Brian Braddock is away working for the covert British agency
    R.C.X.
-   MODRED THE MYSTIC - briefly assumes the mantle of Captain Britain by
    syphoning off Braddock's energies in an effort to defeat Merlyn.
-   KELSEY LEIGH KIRKLAND - receives the Sword of Might from Braddock,
    after she is killed defending Captain America.

Alternate universe versions

Captain Britain Corps

Founded by Merlyn, the CAPTAIN BRITAIN CORPS are formed to defend the
Multiverse. Each member protected his or her reality based on their
dimensional equivalent of Britain, and was powered by the friction
between dimensions. Prominent members aside from Braddock include
Captain Albion and Captain UK. The group includes multiple versions of
Braddock, as well, including Captain England, Crusader X, and others
named Captain Britain.

Albion

BRAN BARDIC is from a world ravaged by war for almost a century. This
version of Braddock chose the Sword of Might over the Amulet of Right
and would later travel to Earth-616 and ally himself with Black Air and
Shadow-X before creating an army of Shadow Captains in an attempt to
take over England and overthrow the Captain Britain Corps.

Age of Apocalypse

In the Age of Apocalypse, Brian Braddock never becomes Captain Britain,
and is one of the members of the Human High Council, alongside Moira
Trask, Bolivar Trask, Emma Frost, and Mariko Yashida. Braddock is also
the most vocal advocate for the extermination of mutants, much to the
weariness of Yashida and Frost, who seems much less fanatical in their
beliefs. After a failed attempt on his life, Braddock proposes the
assembly of the entire Council fleet to attack Apocalypse's capital.
However, it is revealed that Braddock had in fact become a victim of a
mind control device that forced him to act as a mole for Donald Pierce
and his Reavers, all servants of Apocalypse. Braddock dies at Pierce's
hands when he overcomes his influence and refuses to kill Emma Frost.

In an alternate AoA timeline, from What If?: Age of Apocalypse,
Captain Britain is a member of the Defenders (their version of the
Avengers), and uses Iron Man's armor. In this timeline, Legion kills
both Professor Xavier and Magneto, therefore the X-Men never existed, so
mankind's only hope lies with the Defenders. The other Defender members
are Weapon X, the Thing (using a metal prosthetic arm), X-Man, Colossus,
Brother Voodoo, Molecule Man, and Sauron, led by Captain America (who
wields Thor's hammer, Mjolnir). During the final offensive against
Apocalypse, Captain Britain loses his life fighting the Hulk (one of
Apocalypse's Horsemen in this reality), who rips Britain's body apart.

 Zombies

A zombie version of Captain Britain briefly appears in the miniseries
 Zombies while the Silver Surfer travels the globe. He also
briefly appears in  Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness, having
been zombified by the world-racing newly infected Quicksilver.

Ultimate 

In the Ultimate  Universe, Captain Britain is a member of the
European Defense Initiative (the EU equivalent of the Ultimates), along
with Captain Italy, Captain France, Captain Spain and several unnamed
members most likely from other European countries, all of whom have the
same powers: flight, super strength and a force field. All four of them
developed their powers from the super powered exo-suits developed by
Professor Sir James Braddock, who oversees the EDI super soldier
program. Captain Britain and the other members of European Defense
Initiative helped the Ultimates track down and contain Thor and they
released the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the X-Men during the
Liberators' attack on America. They are also seen helping to pull up the
Statue of Liberty after the battle is over. During Ultimatum,
Captain Britain (along with other Captains) is discussing how to take
action against Magneto in the Houses of Parliament. However, Multiple
Man bursts in and sets off a bomb, destroying the Houses of Parliament
and everyone inside. His status is unknown on panel, although he was
listed in the in memoriam section at the end of Ultimatum #5. He
survived the attack at the Houses of Parliament, although he succumbed
to the cancer caused by using one of the first versions of the Captain
Britain suit, and his brother James took the mantle of Captain
Britain.

Dr. Jamie Braddock is revealed to be the new Captain Britain in the
Ultimates.

Reception

IGN ranked Captain Britain as the 79th greatest comic book hero of all
time stating, "as he is the only  hero to receive the benefit of

 Universe", and 34th in their list of "The Top 50
Avengers".

An article in the Times of London in March 2016 stated, "Captain
Britain's nemesis turned out to be lack of popularity, however, and his
