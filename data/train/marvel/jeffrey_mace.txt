Publication history

The superhero the Patriot debuted in The Human Torch #4 (cover-dated
Spring 1941; mis-numbered #3 on cover), with both a two-page text
story by writer Ray Gill, with a spot illustration by artist Bill
Everett, and a 10-page comics story by writer Gill and artist George
Mandel. The character went on to appear in the first of two Human
Torch issues both inadvertently numbered #5, and known to collectors as
#5[a] (Summer 1941), in a story by Gill and artist Sid Greene.
Concurrently, the Patriot began as regular feature in the superhero
anthology  Mystery Comics, appearing in issues #21–44 (July 1941
– June 1943) and #49 -74 (Nov. 1943 – July 1946), making him one of
Timely's most popular characters in the second tier beneath stars
Captain America, the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner. The Patriot story
"Death Stalks the Shipyard", from  Mystery Comics #29, was
reprinted during the Silver Age of Comic Books in  Super-Heroes
#16 (Sept. 1968).

A simulacrum of the Patriot was temporarily created from the mind of
Rick Jones, along with those of the Blazing Skull, the Fin, and the
Golden Age Angel and Vision, to aid the superhero team the Avengers
during the Kree-Skrull War.

The Patriot first appeared in modern times in a four-part flashback
story running through The Invaders #5–6 (March & May 1976) and 
Premiere #29–30 (April & June 1976), set during World War II which
retconned him as a member of a newly created superhero team, the Liberty
Legion. That team later appeared alongside Fantastic Four member the
Thing in a two-part time travel story, set during World War II, in
 Two-in-One #20 (Oct. 1976) and  Two-in-One Annual
(1976).

When  had revived the character Captain America in 1964,
the story explained that he had been missing in action and in suspended
animation since 1945. This discrepancy with his postwar comic-book
appearances was later explained as the result of replacement heroes
taking on the mantle. As the third Captain America, Jeffrey Mace would
have been behind the mask in Captain America Comics #59–75 (Nov. 1946
– Feb. 1950) and other comics during that period. Mace succeeded the
second Captain America, William Naslund (formerly the Spirit of '76),
who was shown in What If?_ vol. 1, #4 (Aug. 1977) as having been killed
in 1946.

Mace appeared briefly in a flashback in Captain America #215 (Nov.
1977), then as a guest-star in Captain America Annual #6 (1982) with
his death depicted in #285 (Sept. 1983). In a flashback, the Patriot
co-starred in a World War II adventure with Captain America in Captain
America Annual #13 (1994) and in a post-war adventure with the All
Winners Squad in All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special (2009).

A retelling of Jeffrey Mace's origin and time as Captain America is told
in the 2010 mini-series Captain America: Patriot. This was collected
with the All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special and What If?_ #4
in 2011. What If?_ #4 was also collected that same year in a Captain
America Legacy volume collecting the debuts of the Captain America
replacements.
