DOCTOR STEPHEN VINCENT STRANGE, best known under his alias DOCTOR
STRANGE, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
published by . Created by artist and character
conceptualist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in Strange
Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963). A former neurosurgeon, Strange
serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against
magical and mystical threats. Debuting in the Silver Age of comics, the
character has been featured in several comic book series and adapted in
a variety of media including video games, an animated television show,

Magician, Strange was created to bring a different kind of character
and themes of mysticism to .

Doctor Strange was an egotistical but very brilliant surgeon. After a
car accident destroys his hands and hinders his ability to perform
surgery, he searches the globe for a way to repair them and encounters
the Ancient One. After becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's
students, he becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts as well as
martial arts. Along with knowing many powerful spells, he has a costume
with two mystical objects - the Cloak of Levitation and Eye of Agamotto
that gives him added powers. Strange is aided along the way by his
friend and servant to the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong, and a large assortment
of mystical objects. He takes up residence in a mansion called the
Sanctum Sanctorum, located in New York City. Later, Strange takes the
title of Sorcerer Supreme.

Avengers". The character was first portrayed in live action by Peter
Hooten in the 1978 television movie Dr. Strange. A  Studios
live-action film adaptation starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead
role is set for a November 2016 theatrical release.


Publication history

Creation

Artist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee have described the character as
having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, "On my own,
I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script
of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in 
Comics. My character wound up being named Dr. Strange because he would
appear in Strange Tales." In a 1963 letter to Jerry Bails, Lee
called the character Ditko's idea, saying,

Early years

Doctor Strange debuted in Strange Tales #110 (July 1963), a split
book shared with the feature "The Human Torch". Doctor Strange appeared
in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page origin
story in #115 (Dec. 1963). Scripter Lee's take on the character was
inspired by the Chandu the Magician radio program that aired on the
Mutual Broaasting System in the 1930s. He had Doctor Strange
accompany spells with elaborate incantations; though these often
referenced established mythological figures, Lee has said he never had
any idea what the incantations meant and used them simply because they
sounded mystical and mysterious. Ditko showcased surrealistic
mystical landscapes and increasingly vivid visuals that helped make the
feature a favorite of college students at the time. Comics historian
Mike Benton wrote,

[Splash page for Dr. Strange Master of Black Magic!_ in Strange Tales
#110 (July 1963), the character's first appearance. Art by Steve Ditko]
"People who read Doctor Strange thought people at  must be heads
[i.e., drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor
Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971, "because they had had similar
experiences high on mushrooms. But I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I
think any artists do." Originating in the early 1960s, the character
was a predictor of counter-cultural trends in art prior to them becoming
more established in the later 1960s, according to comic historian
Bradford W. Wright: "Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth
counterculture's fascination with Eastern mysticism and psychedelia."

As co-plotter and later sole plotter in the  Method, Ditko took
Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In a 17-issue story arc in
Strange Tales #130-146 (March 1965-July 1966), Ditko introduced the
cosmic character Eternity, who personified the universe and was depicted
as a silhouette filled with the cosmos. As historian Bradford W.
Wright described,

Golden Age artist/writer Bill Everett succeeded Ditko as artist with
issues #147-152, followed by Marie Severin through #160 and Dan Adkins
through #168, the final issue before the Nick Fury feature moved to
its own title and Strange Tales was renamed Doctor Strange.
Expanded to 20 pages per issue, the Doctor Strange solo series ran 15
issues, #169-183 (June 1968-Nov. 1969), continuing the numbering of
Strange Tales. Thomas wrote the run of new stories, joined
after the first three issues by the art team of penciler Gene Colan and
inker Tom Palmer through the end. Colan drastically altered the look of
the series, as Thomas recounted: "…he had his own view of what these
other worlds should look like. Everyone else sort of copied Ditko's
versions of those extra dimensions, which were great and wonderful. When
Gene came on, he didn't feel a real rapport with that, I guess, so his
extra dimensions tended to be just blackness and smoke and things of
that sort… Sometimes it was a little strange for a dimension Doc Strange
had been to before to look different when drawn by Gene, but nobody
complained." Thomas recalled in 2000 that he returned to work a day
late from a weekend comic book convention to find that  production
manager Sol Brodsky had assigned Doctor Strange to writer Archie
Goodwin, newly ensconced at  and writing Iron Man. Thomas
convinced Brodsky to allow him to continue writing the title. "I got
very possessive about Doctor Strange," Thomas recalled. "It wasn't a
huge seller, but [by the time it was canceled] we were selling the low
40 percent range of more than 400,000 print run, so it was actually
selling a couple hundred thousand copies [but] at the time you needed to
sell even more."

After plans were announced for a never-realized split book series
featuring Doctor Strange and Iceman, each in solo adventures,
Strange next appeared in the first three issues (December 1971-June
1972) of the quarterly showcase title  Feature. He appeared in
both the main story detailing the formation of superhero "non-team" the
Defenders, and the related back-up story. The character then starred
in a revival solo series in  Premiere #3-14 (July 1972-March
1974). This arc marked the debut of another recurring foe, the
entity Shuma-Gorath, created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank
Brunner. In issues #8-10 (May–September 1973), Strange was forced to
shut down the Ancient One's mind, causing his mentor's physical death.
Strange then assumed the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Englehart and
Brunner created another multi-issue storyline featuring sorcerer
Sise-Neg ("Genesis" spelled backward) going back through history,
collecting all magical energies, until he reaches the beginning of the
universe, becomes all-powerful and creates it anew, leaving Strange to
wonder whether this was, paradoxically, the original creation. Stan Lee,
seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to
print a retraction saying this was not God but a god, to avoid
offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake
letter from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to
 from Texas.  unwittingly printed the letter and dropped the
retraction. [Doctor Strange#177 (Feb. 1969), the debut of
Strange's short-lived new look. Cover art by Gene Colan and Tom Palmer]
The  Premiere series segued to the character's second ongoing
title, Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts, also known as
Doctor Strange vol. 2, which ran 81 issues (June 1974-February
1987). Doctor Strange #14 featured a crossover story with The
Tomb of Dracula #44, another series which was being drawn by Gene Colan
at the time. In Englehart's final story, he sent Dr. Strange back in
time to meet Benjamin Franklin. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked
Englehart's work on Doctor Strange with artists Brunner and Colan
ninth on its list of the "Top 10 1970s ."

1980s

Strange met his allies Topaz in #75 (Feb. 1986) and Rintrah in #80 (Dec.
1986). The series ended with a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum
Sanctorum, was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was
Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important
artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and
several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil
serpent god Set expired.

The title was discontinued so that the character's adventures could be
transferred to another split book format series. Strange Tales vol. 2,
#1-19 (April 1987-October 1988) was shared with street heroes Cloak and
Dagger. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange's quest to
reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrect the
Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team's title.

1990s

Strange was returned to his own series, this time titled Doctor
Strange: Sorcerer Supreme, which ran 90 issues (November 1988-June
1996). The initial creative team was writer Peter B. Gillis and
artists Richard Case and Randy Emberlin, with storylines often spanning
multiple issues. Strange lost the title of "Sorcerer Supreme" in issues
#48-49 (December 1992-January 1993) when he refused to fight a war on
behalf of the Vishanti, the mystical entities that empower his spells.
During this time the series became part of the "Midnight Sons" group of
's supernatural comics. Doctor Strange found new sources
of magical strength in the form of chaos magic, as well as a magic
construct he used as a proxy. He would form the Secret Defenders
with a rotating roster of heroes, and reunite with the original
Defenders. Strange regained his title in Doctor Strange: Sorcerer
Supreme #80 (Aug. 1995).

Strange appeared, together with the Human Torch and the Thing in the
one-shot publication Strange Tales vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 1994).

The character was featured in several limited series. The first was
Doctor Strange: The Flight of Bones #1-#4 (February–May 1999), with a
series of spontaneous combustions by criminals instigated by old foe
Dormammu. Strange was the catalyst for the creation of a trio of
sorceresses in Witches #1-#4 (August–November 2004). The Strange
limited series (November 2004-July 2005) by writers J. Michael
Straczynski and Samm Barnes updated the character's origin. Another
limited series, Doctor Strange: The Oath #1-5 (December 2006-April
2007), written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Marcos Martin,
focused on Strange's responsibilities as sorcerer and doctor.

Doctor Strange appeared in four graphic novels over the years: Doctor
Strange: Into Shamballa (1986); Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph
and Torment (1989); Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death
(1992); and Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen?_
(1997).

Recalled issue

Jackson Guice's cover for Doctor Strange #15 (1990) used Christian
music singer Amy Grant's likeness without her permission, leading to
a complaint saying that the cover gave the appearance that she was
associating with witchcraft. A US District Court sealed an out-of-court
settlement between Grant and  in early 1991, with a consent decree
in which  did not admit to liability or wrongdoing.

2000s

Strange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s. He
appeared regularly in The Amazing Spider-Man under J. Michael
Straczynski, before being cast into a time loop by Baron Mordo. He later
appeared on and off in The New Avengers, where he was stated as being
part of the secret group known as the Illuminati to deal with future
threats to Earth. Ultimately Strange joined the team and allowed them to
use his home as a base after the events of Civil War, which he sat
out. Doctor Strange was critical of the federal Superhuman Registration
Act and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage.

During the Bendis run, Doctor Doom attacked the Avengers and manipulated
the Scarlet Witch into decimating the mutant population; Doctor
Strange's failure to stop the latter and his failure to realize Doom's
hand in the former caused him to start to doubt his abilities. After he
was forced to use dark magic to confront an enraged Hulk, followed
by further use of dark spells to save the New Avengers from the Hood's
supervillain army, Strange renounced his status as Sorcerer Supreme,
as he felt that he was no longer worthy of it. The Eye of Agamotto
passing the mantle to Brother Voodoo.

He was also featured in The Order, which spun out of the 2000
Defenders revival, and the Indefensible Defenders mini-series.

2010s

Doctor Strange appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013
The New Avengers series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through the final
issue #34 (January 2013). Renamed Doctor Voodoo, the newly appointed
Sorcerer Supreme sacrifices himself in order to stop the powerful
mystical entity Agamotto from reclaiming the Eye. The following
issue, a guilt-ridden Strange rejoins the New Avengers, and offers the
team his servant Wong to act as their housekeeper. He and Wong are seen
working with improvised teams of Avengers in later incidents.

Strange eventually regains his position of Sorcerer Supreme when the
ghost of Doctor Voodoo's brother, Daniel Drumm, attempts to attack him
by possessing various Avengers. He manages to defeat him with the use of
dark magic without being corrupted by it. The spirit of the Ancient One
appears to Strange to inform him that his willingness to fight for the
world, even when not officially Sorcerer Supreme, coupled with his
ability to use black magic when necessary and avoid its corruptive
influence, has proven that he deserves the mantle.

He continues to appear in the pages of the 2013 incarnation of New
Avengers, which focuses on the Illuminati as they deal with
"Incursions", cases where two parallel Earths collide and cause the
destruction of both universes. As such, the group have engaged in
considerable acts of moral ambiguity in dealing with each impending
incursion. In addition, Doctor Strange has become the host to a
dangerous demon after offering himself up in order to save Princess
Phan, a child who the demon was possessing. The demon ultimately
possessed Strange when fighting a group of heroes from a world
threatened by an incursion and kills most of those heroes, resulting in
the Illuminati having to stop him.

Eight months into the future, it is revealed that Doctor Strange later
becomes the leader of the Black Priests.

After the final incursion merges the remaining worlds into one, Doctor
Strange acts as the right-hand man of Doctor Doom, who has become the
ruler and god of this world after erasing all recollection of the
separate realities that existed before this one, accepting the status
quo as Doom is actually very good at his assigned job. However, when the
Cabal emerge into this new world from a "life-pod" they used to escape
the destruction and kill one of the Thor Corps who acted as Doom's
security, Strange is forced to open a second pod and release the
surviving heroes of Earth-616, with Black Panther and Mister Fantastic
particularly shocked to learn of Strange's alliance with Doctor Doom.
After he explains the situation to his former allies, Strange banishes
the heroes of Earth-616 to distant corners of Battleworld when Doom
finds them and kills a Phoenix Force-enhanced Cyclops. When Strange
informs Doom that, regardless of his power, he will always fear Reed
Richards, Doom kills Strange in an outrage. Although Doom attempts
to claim that the heroes were the ones who killed Strange, the
displaced heroes are eventually able to rally the various realms against
Doom, culminating in Reed taking Doom's powers and restoring the
multiverse, starting with recreating Earth-616, also restoring
Doctor Strange to life.


Fictional character biography

Dr. Stephen Strange is a brilliant but egotistical doctor who only cares
about wealth from his career. However, a car accident shatters the bones
in his hands. The damage effectively ends his ability to conduct
surgery, since his hands now tremble uncontrollably. Too proud to take
on a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to restore his
hands, consulting doctors, homeopathic treatments, and traveling around
the world to remote regions for exotic cures, to no avail.

After he exhausts his funds, he becomes homeless, forcing him to perform
"back alley" medical procedures for cash. Depressed and still searching,
Strange locates a hermit called the Ancient One (who is actually the
Earth's Sorcerer Supreme) in the Himalayas. The Ancient One refuses to
help Strange because of his selfishness, but senses a good side that he
attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange's goodness
appears when he discovers the Ancient One's disciple, Baron Mordo,
attempting to kill the old man. After a confrontation with Mordo leads
to him being shackled with restraining spells preventing him from either
attacking Mordo or warning the Ancient One, Strange desperately and
selflessly accepts the Ancient One's offer to become his apprentice to
have some hope of helping the old man. The Ancient One, pleased at
Strange's profound change of heart, accepts the westerner and promptly
frees him from the restraining spells while explaining he was aware of
Mordo's treachery all along. Strange soon becomes Mordo's most enduring
enemy, as the Ancient One teaches the doctor the mystic arts.
After completing his training, Strange returns to New York and takes up
residence within the Sanctum Sanctorum, a townhouse located in Greenwich
Village which is guarded by Strange's personal servant Wong.

As the Ancient One's disciple, Strange encounters the entity
Nightmare, and other mystical foes before meeting Dormammu, a
warlord from an alternate dimension called the "Dark Dimension". Strange
is aided by a nameless girl, later called Clea, who is eventually
revealed to be Dormammu's niece. When Strange helps a weakened
Dormammu drive off the rampaging Mindless Ones and return them to their
prison, he is allowed to leave unchallenged.


Powers and abilities

Strange is a practicing magician who draws his powers from mystical
entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and
Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells. Strange also wields
mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation which enables him
to fly, the Eye of Agamotto whose light is used to negate evil
magic, the Book of the Vishanti which contains knowledge of white
magic, and the Orb of Agamotto which is used as a crystal ball.

In addition to his magical abilities, he is trained in several martial
arts disciplines, and has shown proficiency with numerous magically
conjured weapons including swords and axes. Strange was a skilled
neurosurgeon before nerve damage impaired his hands.

Doctor Strange is described as "the mightiest magician in the
cosmos" and "more powerful by far than any of your fellow humanoids"
by Eternity, the sentience of the  Universe. He holds the
title of Sorcerer Supreme from 1973 (with the death of the Ancient
One) to the present, except during an interruption from 1992 to
1995. He relinquishes the title once again in 2009, but reclaims
it in 2012 when he proves himself willing to protect the world even
without the title.


Other versions

Magnus. Doctor Strange uses his remaining power to reform the superhero
team the Defenders in A-Next #3 (1998) and to fight the Norse god of
mischief, Loki, Last Hero Standing #4 (February 2005).

The Ultimate  title Ultimate  Team-Up introduced a version
of the character called "Stephen Strange, Jr.", the son of the original
Doctor Strange, in Ultimate  Team-Up #12 (July 2002). The
character was killed in battle by the Ultimate  version of

pseudonym "R. Berns"), and Jack Kirby (artist) introduced a criminal
scientist and Ph.D. with the same surname (called "Carl Strange").

Strange" in Tales of Suspense #41 (1963), the character gained mental
powers in a freak lightning strike.
