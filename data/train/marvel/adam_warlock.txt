Publication history

1960s to 1970s

The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 (Sept.-Oct. 1967) in a
story written by Stan Lee and pencilled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby.
After a second appearance as "Him" in Thor #165-166 (June–July 1969),
writer and then  editor-in-chief Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane
significantly revamped Him as the allegorical Messiah ADAM WARLOCK in
 Premiere #1 (April 1972).

In 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the
musical Jesus Christ Superstar and sought to bring the story to comic
books in a superhero context: "Yes, I had some trepidation about the
Christ parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled
it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on
religion... at least not overtly."  Choosing to use a preexisting
character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream
 Earth, he created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a
chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun.
Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and
golden lightning bolt as their homage to Fawcett Comics' 1940s-1950s
character Captain .

The story continued in the series The Power of Warlock, which ran
eight issues (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973), with some plotlines concluded
in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #176-178 (June-Aug. 1974).

In a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker
said the series

[ Premiere #1 (April 1972). Debut of Him as Adam Warlock. Cover
art by Gil Kane and Dan Adkins.] Writer-artist Jim Starlin revived
Warlock in Strange Tales #178-181 (Feb.-Aug. 1975). Warlock's
adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character
through an extended storyline referred to as "The Magus Saga."

The reimagined title continued the numbering of The Power of Warlock
and began with Warlock #9 (Oct. 1975) and ran seven issues. The
bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was
eventually co-penciled and inked by Steve Leialoha. Some plot threads
were concluded in  Team-Up #55 (March 1977), Avengers Annual
#7 (Nov. 1977) and  Two-in-One Annual #2 (Dec. 1977).

Starlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled,

Artist Alan Weiss recalled in a 2006 interview there was a "lost" Adam
Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the
Jonathan Swift novel Gulliver's Travels. Portions of it were
printed in the second volume of  Masterworks: Warlock. The
remainder of the artwork was lost in a New York City taxicab in
1976.

Warlock's adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the
six-issue limited series Special Edition Warlock (Dec. 1982 - May
1983). This reprint series was itself reprinted, with yet another
set of new Starlin covers, as Warlock vol. 2 (May-Oct. 1992).

Although regarded as deceased at the time, Warlock made a brief
appearance in  Two-in-One #63 (May 1980).

1990s revival

Eleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his
supporting cast in the miniseries Infinity Gauntlet #1-6 (July-Dec.
1991). This plot development was a continuation of a larger
storyline that began with the resurrection of Thanos in Silver Surfer
vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990).

Following the events of the The Infinity Gauntlet, Warlock and several
compatriots starred in the series Warlock and the Infinity Watch.
Initially written by Starlin and drawn by Angel Medina, it ran 42 issues
(Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series
Infinity War (June-Nov. 1992) and Infinity Crusade (June-Dec. 1993).

Warlock starred in several limited series, including Silver
Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection #1-4 (March–June 1993); The Warlock
Chronicles #1-8 (July 1993 - Feb.1994); and Warlock vol. 3, #1-4
(Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999), by writer-penciler Tom Lyle. The character
was featured in the intercompany crossovers between  and
the Malibu Comics "Ultraverse" in the one-shot Rune / Silver Surfer
(April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); Rune vol. 2, #1-7 (Sept.
1995 - April 1996), and the two-issue Ultraverse Unlimited (June and
Sept. 1996).

Following the unrelated, 1999-2000 series Warlock vol. 4, featuring
the alien cybernetic character Warlock of the New Mutants team, Adam
Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series The Infinity
Abyss #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002);  Universe: The End #1-6 (May-Aug.
2003; first four issues biweekly); and Thanos #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April
2004). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited
series Warlock vol. 5 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer Greg Pak and
artist Charles Adlard. After appearances in Annihilation Conquest:
Quasar #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007) and Annihilation Conquest # 1-6 (Nov.
2007 - April 2008), he was a key character in Guardians of the Galaxy
vol. 2, #1-25 (July 2008 - April 2010), The Thanos Imperative #1 (June
2010) and the Ignition one-shot (May 2010)

The character appeared in Thanos Annual #1 (July 2014), and in the
original graphic novels Thanos: The Infinity Revelation (August
2014) and Thanos: The Infinitiy Relativity (June 2015),
written by Jim Starlin; Warlock will furthermore appear in the graphic
novel Thanos: The Infinity Finale as well as in the connected
mini-series The Infinity Entity (both announced for Spring 2016), also
written by Starlin.


Fictional character biography

Creation, metamorphosis, and death

Scientists on Earth calling themselves the Enclave created an
artificial, perfect human, who initially calls himself "Him". After
rebelling against his creators, and having a conflict with Thor, Him
decides to leave Earth and travels into space.

He encounters the High Evolutionary, who gives him the name "Warlock."
The High Evolutionary requests Warlock's help in saving the artificially
created planet, Counter-Earth, from the evil Man Beast and gives
Warlock the green Soul Gem (also referred to as the "Soul Jewel"), which
allows Warlock to capture souls of other beings. When he arrives on
Counter-Earth, Warlock is given the name Adam by four teenagers who
befriend him. After the Man Beast's defeat, Warlock leaves Counter-Earth
to find a new purpose.

In his travels through space, Warlock encounters the Universal Church of
Truth, an intergalactic religious organization led by the corrupt
Magus. Warlock allies with Pip the Troll, the assassin
Gamora, and Gamora's employer and adoptive father, Thanos of Titan
to oppose the Magus. Eventually, Warlock discovers that the Magus is a
future version of himself who traveled back in time after being driven
insane by the use of his Soul Gem. Warlock chooses to alter his
timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his
own soul to prevent the Magus from ever existing. Warlock then
continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not
knowing exactly when it will happen.

When the Stranger attempts to steal Warlock's Soul Gem, Warlock learns
about five other related gems. Thanos gains possession of these gems
with the intention of destroying Earth's sun. When Thanos causes mortal
harm to Pip and Gamora, Warlock takes their souls to end their
suffering. Warlock then enlists the aid of the Avengers, Captain ,
and Moondragon to stop Thanos. During the battle, Warlock's younger self
appears and takes the older Warlock's soul. Inside the gem, Adam is
reunited with Pip, Gamora and others in a utopia known as Soul
World. Warlock's soul is temporarily freed from the Soul Gem,
allowing him to turn Thanos to stone and save Earth.

Rebirth

[The modern version of Adam Warlock: Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2,
#17 (Oct. 2009). Cover art by Mike Perkins.] After being resurrected,
Thanos once again collects the Infinity Gems, forming them into the
Infinity Gauntlet. When the Silver Surfer and Drax the Destroyer
oppose Thanos, he captures them in the Soul Gem. In the world of the
Soul Gem, the Surfer meets Adam Warlock and convinces him that his help
is needed again to defeat Thanos. Warlock agrees and Pip and
Gamora decided to accompany him. Warlock transmits himself and his two
friends into new bodies and leads a group of Earth's superheroes,
defeating Thanos.

Warlock obtains the Gauntlet, becoming a near-supreme being of the
universe. The cosmic Living Tribunal, whose power and authority
exceeds Warlock's, decides that Warlock cannot be trusted to keep the
Infinity Gauntlet and instructs him to divide the gems among other
beings of Warlock's choosing. Warlock keeps the soul gem for himself
and gives one gem each to Pip, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon,
and a reformed Thanos. Warlock dubs the group the Infinity
Watch.

During Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet, he purged good
and evil from his being, leaving him entirely a creature of logic. His
good and evil aspects take on lives as two new physical beings — the
evil half becomes a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half is
a woman calling herself the Goddess. When they threaten the universe,
Warlock defeats them with the aid of the Watch and other superheroes,
absorbing them into the Soul Gem.

The Infinity Watch disbands when the infinity gems are stolen by Rune, a
vampire from a parallel universe. Warlock pursues Rune,
recovering the gems and returning to his native universe.

Warlock plays a role in protecting the universe several more times,
including threats from clones of Thanos, the Heart of the
Universe, and the interdimensional being Hunger.

Annihilation: Conquest

Moondragon and Phyla-Vell later seek Warlock's help to free the alien
Kree from the invading Phalanx. Once the Phalanx is defeated,
Warlock joins the newly formed Guardians of the Galaxy. While with
the Guardians, Warlock attempts to repair damage to the Spacetime
continuum, which causes him to become the Magus. Once again leading
the Universal Church of Truth, the Magus allies himself with Lord
Mar-Vell, but is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal
Church of Truth resurrects the Magus as a child, but he is quickly
captured and imprisoned by the Annihilators. His cocoon remains
under the watch of the Annihilators.

While on a new quest, Thanos encounters Warlock's soul in Death's
domain. It follows Thanos back to the living world, where it regains
human form. Warlock accompanies Thanos on a journey as their universe
merges with another one. Due to the convergence, Warlock is
retroactively replaced by his counterpart from the other universe.


Powers and abilities

As Him, the character possessed superhuman strength; speed; durability;
stamina; agility and the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for energy
projection, flight and recuperation (e.g., creating a cocoon for
self-preservation and regeneration). However, Him sacrificed the
majority of these powers by prematurely emerging from his cocoon in
order to defend the High Evolutionary from an assault by the Man-Beast.
In compensation, the High Evolutionary gave Him the Soul Gem. The
Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric
hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It contains an idyllic
pocket universe that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. The
latest version of Warlock uses "Quantum magic" and can manipulate
energy; create force fields; teleport; travel faster than light and
detect or produce wormholes and other irregularities in space on a
cosmic scale.

He has the power to devolve the followers of Man-Beast into the animals
from which they evolved, as well as revert the Brute into
Counter-Earth Reed Richards. This power comes from his soul gem.


Other versions

The Magus

[The Magus, from Strange Tales #181 (Aug. 1975). Art by Jim Starlin.]
There have been three incarnations of the Magus.

The original Magus is an older, evil Adam Warlock who has traveled to
the past and rules a religious empire called the Universal Church of
Truth. To ensure his own creation, he guides his younger self through a
series of actions that will result in him becoming the
Magus. With the aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future
and destroys the Magus's timeline, erasing him from existence.

When Warlock acquires the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels good and evil
from his soul, unintentionally giving them corporeal forms. The evil
half names himself the Magus and attempts to gain the Infinity Gauntlet
for himself. He fails, and Warlock traps him in the Soul Gem. Since he
is only part of a soul, he cannot interact with the other inhabitants of
Soul World and exists only as a phantom. The Magus escapes the Soul
Gem in an immaterial form, absorbing the life energies of others to
regain tangibility. He is defeated by Genis-Vell and reverts to an
ethereal entity. The Magus retaliates by wounding Genis'
friend Moondragon and claiming she is destined to become his slave.

Warlock becomes the third Magus when he repairs a damage to the
spacetime continuum. This Magus works for the evil Lord Mar-Vell, and is
killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth
resurrects him as a child, who is then imprisoned by the
Annihilators.

The Goddess

The Goddess is the embodiment of Adam Warlock's goodness, created when
he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to remove the quality from
himself. She appears as a central figure in the 1993 limited
series Infinity Crusade. She assembles a collection of cosmic cubes
and forges them into a Cosmic Egg. Using its power, she recreates
Counter-Earth, dubbing it Paradise Omega. Embarking on a crusade to
eliminate sin, the Goddess uses telepathy to control spiritual beings
across the universe, recruiting them to her cause. When Warlock and
Earth's other heroes learn she plans to destroy all sin by destroying
anything capable of sin, they rally against her. She is defeated when
her followers learn her true goal, and is absorbed into the soul
gem.

Earth X

In the Earth X limited series, Mar-Vell is reincarnated as the child
of the synthetic Adam Warlock/Him and Kismet/Her.
