EDDIE BROCK is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
published by . Created by David Michelinie and Todd
McFarlane, the character was originally a comic book supervillain. His
earliest appearance is a cameo in Web of Spider-Man #18 (September
1986), before making his first full appearance in The Amazing
Spider-Man #300 (May 1988) as the first and best-known incarnation
of VENOM. The character has since appeared in many 
publications, including his own series Venom. Introduced as a villain
of Spider-Man, the character becomes an anti-hero, working with and
against superheroes.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who
exposes the identity of a serial killer only for the real killer to be
caught by Spider-Man, thus he accused the wrong man. Disgraced and
suicidal, he comes into contact with an alien Symbiote, rejected by
Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom and
together they seek out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he
repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to
operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems
"innocent". In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, he
gains a new Symbiote and becomes the anti-hero ANTI-VENOM. However, that
symbiote is sacrificed to help cure the "Spider-Island" epidemic during
the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he is bonded to the Toxin symbiote. Though
he is a human with no powers, the Venom Symbiote suit bestows upon him a
range of abilities including many of the powers belonging to Spider-Man,
the Symbiote's original host.

Debuting in the Modern Age of Comic Books, the character of Eddie Brock
has featured in other -endorsed products such as animated
television series; video games; merchandise such as action figures, and
trading cards; and the Spider-Man 3 feature film in which he was
played by actor Topher Grace. Eddie Brock's incarnation of Venom was
rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters, and was the
22nd greatest villain on IGN's 100 Greatest Comic Villains of all
time. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the
character: "What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man
turned into one of the  web-slinger's greatest nightmares."


Publication history

Creation and conception

Writer David Michelinie and artist Todd McFarlane are generally credited
with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and
concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the
character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie
wrote to the comic book industry magazine Wizard, which had referred
to Michelinie in issue #17 as "co-creator" of Venom. In his letter,
printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the
character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without
McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it
did.[First cover appearance of Venom as depicted by co-creator Todd
McFarlane.]

Writer Peter David corroborated Michelinie's view in his "But I Digress"
column in the June 4, 1993 Comics Buyer's Guide, in which he stated
that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the
time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on The
Spectacular Spider-Man and wrote the "Sin Eater" storyline from which
Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was
assigned to the art duties on Amazing. Because artists who design the
costumes or appearances of major characters and/or illustrate their
first appearances are generally credited as co-creators, Venom
represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's
appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.

Erik Larsen responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that
was printed in Wizard #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed
Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie
merely "swiped" the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a
character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional,
unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's
rendition of the character that made it commercial.

[Erik Larsen, who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on Amazing
Spider-Man, added the long tongue and drool to Venom's appearance.] The
preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself - to
which Michelinie did not contribute - have also been noted. The original
idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the
character Venom was conceived of by a  reader from
Norridge, Illinois named Randy Schueller.  purchased the idea
for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, Jim Shooter, sent
Schueller a letter acknowledging 's desire to acquire the idea
from him, in 1982. Schueller's design was then modified by Mike Zeck,
becoming the Symbiote costume. For example, Shooter came up with the
idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly
influenced by the intended costume design for the new Spider-Woman, with
artists Mike Zeck and Rick Leonardi, as well as others, designing the
black-and-white costume. Writer/artist John Byrne asserts on his
website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological
material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' Iron Fist ''
to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and
then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up
not using the idea on that title, but that Roger Stern later asked him
if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn
plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the
title. It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who had
established that the costume was a sentient alien being and also that it
was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on The Amazing
Spider-Man that preceded Michelinie's. Regardless, Peter David's
position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of
creating a separate character using the alien symbiote was
Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea
to create such a character, the character would not have existed.

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did
indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design
("a big guy in the black costume"). However, he contends that it was he
(McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; "I just
wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black
suit."

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators
and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by
the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders
of Image Comics.

Venom's existence was first indicated in Web of Spider-Man #18 (Sept.
1986), when he shoves Peter Parker in front of a subway train without
Parker's spider-sense warning him, though only Brock's hand is seen
on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in Web of
Spider-Man #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high
story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming
through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his
spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until Amazing
Spider-Man editor Jim Salicrup required a villain for that book's 300th
issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien
symbiote grafted onto the body of a human female. Salicrup accepted the
suggestion, but changed the character to a male. Michelinie then devised
the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues
#298-299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were
written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the
book.


Fictional character biography

Backstory

[Left: Brock bonding with the symbiote. Right: Brock's cameo appearance
as Venom in Amazing Spider-Man #299.] The 1993 limited series Venom:
Lethal Protector describes Brock's history before bonding with the
symbiote. As a child, Edward Allan "Eddie" Brock is raised in a
Roman Catholic household in San Francisco. Eddie's mother dies from
complications during his birth and as a result his father is cold and
unaffectionate towards him. Eddie excels in academics and sports in an
attempt to earn his father's approval but does not succeed. In college,
Brock switches his major to journalism after reading an article on the
Watergate scandal. After graduating he moves to New York City and
obtains a job as a journalist for the Daily Globe. Though he proves
himself to be a highly talented journalist, his father still only treats
him with indifference.

As a reporter, Brock investigates the serial killer Sin-Eater and is
contacted by Emil Gregg, who claims to be the killer. Pressured by
the authorities to reveal the killer's identity, Brock writes an exposé
announcing Gregg as the Sin-Eater. However, the real Sin-Eater is caught
by Spider-Man and Brock is revealed to have been interviewing a
compulsive confessor. Brock is fired from his job in disgrace and
divorced from his wife. Unable to find reputable work, he is forced to
work for tabloid magazines and his father ceases communication with
him entirely. Brock becomes obsessed with gaining revenge against
Spider-Man, blaming him for catching the real Sin-Eater. Brock takes up
bodybuilding to reduce stress but his anger and depression remain.
Meanwhile, Spider-Man uses the sound of bells at a church to remove his
symbiote costume after realizing it is attempting to permanently bond
with him. His professional and personal life shattered, Brock
contemplates suicide and goes to the same church, where he prays to God
for forgiveness. The Symbiote, having waited in the rafters of the
church since leaving Spider-Man, senses Brock and bonds with him,
granting him powers equal and greater to those of Spider-Man, and
imparting knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity.

Venom

Venom begins a campaign of torment against Peter, who is still unaware
of his existence. He first pushes Peter in front of a moving subway
without activating his spider-sense, and later terrorizes
Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane. Venom baits Spider-Man to his apartment
for their first confrontation, where Venom reveals his true identity to
Spider-Man, claiming "You may call me Venom, for that's what I'm paid to
spew out these days!" Spider-Man discovers that the Symbiote has
completely bonded with Brock and cannot be killed without also killing
Brock. Eventually Venom is tricked into weakening himself by expending
too much webbing until the suit lacks enough material to produce
more. Venom is incarcerated in the Vault, from which he makes
repeated escapes and escape attempts, only to suffer defeats and returns
to the Vault.

Brock eventually fakes suicide and escapes after being taken to the
morgue. During a battle with Spider-Man, the Symbiote is seemingly
killed by the plague-inducing villain Styx, giving its life to protect
Brock. Brock is incarcerated and Spider-Man disposes of the Symbiote's
remains. The Symbiote survives by entering a comatose state to fight
off the illness and it returns to Brock, enabling him to again
escape from jail. During the escape, the symbiote asexually reproduces
and leaves behind its spawn. The offspring quickly bonds to Brock's
cell mate, Cletus Kasady, creating Carnage. Venom abducts
Spider-Man and transports him to a remote island to do battle.
Spider-Man fakes his own death to convince Venom that his vendetta is
over. Venom, content with the outcome, resigns himself to life on the
island. Spider-Man eventually faces Carnage but is unable to defeat
him. Spider-Man is forced to ask Venom for help, promising him freedom
in exchange. However, after they defeat Carnage Spider-Man betrays
Venom (who had also resumed his plan of revenge and tried to throttle
the arachnoid hero to death) by summoning the Fantastic Four and sending
him back to prison.

Anti-hero

After seeing a photo of Spider-Man's recently returned parents, Brock
escapes from prison, and kidnaps them. During the resulting
fight, Brock's ex-wife Ann Weying is nearly crushed under a falling
ferris wheel, but Spider-Man saves her. Seeing this act, Venom makes
peace with Spider-Man. In Venom: Lethal Protector (1993), Venom
moves to San Francisco and acts as the protector of an underground
society of homeless people. He is later taken prisoner by the Life
Foundation who harvest the last five spawn within the symbiote to create
super-powered policemen and Brock is forcibly separated from the
symbiote. With Spider-Man's help, Brock is reunited with the
symbiote and they seemingly destroy his spawn, Phage, Lasher, Riot,
Scream and Agony, before escaping. After saving the homeless people,
Venom is accepted into their society and remains their protector.

In the 1993 crossover "Maximum Carnage", Carnage reemerges and begins a
massacre in New York City, and Brock returns to help, feeling
responsible. Venom finds he is no match for Carnage, and seeks help from
Spider-Man, but Spider-Man refuses to work with Venom's violent
methods. Venom, accompanied by Black Cat, Cloak, Morbius and
eventually a desperate Spider-Man, repeatedly confront Carnage and
his allies. Venom ultimately tackles Carnage into
high-voltage generators, rendering Carnage unconscious and allowing his
capture by the Avengers. Brock goes into hiding.

Brock returns in the 1994 limited series Separation Anxiety, in which
he is captured and separated from the symbiote for a government research
project. Venom's spawn: Phage, Lasher, Scream, Riot, and Agony are
revealed to still be alive and arrive to free Brock, seeking his
help to gain control over their symbiotes. Brock is ultimately
reunited with the symbiote, but the experience forces him to evaluate
his relationship with the costume. The 1995 _"Planet of the
Symbiotes"_ event continued the narrative from Separation Anxiety,
with Brock forcing the symbiote to leave him, concerned about how much
influence it may be having on him. The symbiote unleashes a
telepathic scream of sorrow and pain that attracts the other members of
its species to Earth. The story follows the efforts of Brock,
Spider-Man, and Scarlet Spider to stop the invasion and defeat an
escaped and empowered Carnage. Brock is forced to bond
completely and irrevocably with the symbiote in order to inflict psychic
trauma on the symbiotes, causing them to commit suicide.

Return to villainy

When Ann is shot by a new Sin-Eater, Brock forces the Symbiote to bond
with her to heal her injuries. In the process she temporarily
becomes She-Venom but Brock demands the Symbiote return after Ann loses
control and kills a pair of muggers, leaving Ann traumatized. Brock
helps kill the new Sin-Eater. Ann is taken into custody by the
police as they try to hunt Venom and Brock sends her his Symbiote so she
can escape. As She-Venom she again struggles to control
herself. When Brock takes back the Symbiote, she tells him to keep
himself and the Symbiote away from her.

Brock is captured in his sewer hideout and put on trial, with Matt
Murdock acting in his defense, his symbiote held in check by a chemical
inhibitor. Cletus Kassady is called as a witness, but when the case
becomes heated both Kassady and Brock overcome their inhibitors.
Venom, Spider-Man, and Daredevil team up and subdue Carnage. However,
before the trial can continue Venom is unexpectedly taken into custody
by a secret government organization offering him amnesty in exchange for
him becoming their agent. Though Venom at first enjoyed his newfound
immunities, he left after being abandoned during a dangerous
mission. After receiving a head wound, Eddie suffers amnesia. He is
later separated from the symbiote, which is presumed killed by the
government Overreach Committee.

The symbiote survives and tracks down the amnesiac Brock, turning him
into Venom again. Venom infiltrates Ravencroft prison seeking Carnage
and absorbs the Carnage Symbiote. Brock temporarily joins the
Sinister Six to get Spider-Man but after being betrayed by them, he
begins hunting down the members for revenge. He ultimately cripples
Sandman by biting him, leading to Sandman's apparent death.

Venom's rivalry with Spider-Man is renewed when Ann, who lives in fear
since bonding with the Symbiote, commits suicide after seeing Brock
become Venom. Venom however, believes Spider-Man swinging by Ann's
window in his black costume to be the cause. Before he can take
revenge however, the Symbiote is forcefully removed from him by the
human/alien hybrid Senator Ward in order to learn more about
symbiosis. An alien race, secretly operating within the United
States government, clones the Venom symbiote. Venom absorbs the clone,
gains its knowledge, and decides to carry out the aliens' orders.

Cancer and post-Venom

[Eddie Brock, separated from the symbiote, dying from cancer in
Sensational Spider-Man vol. 2 #39 (August 2007).] The 2003 story "The
Hunger" introduced new elements to Brock's origin, revealing that Brock
had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond
with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because
the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which sustains the
symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues
Spider-Man out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than
for revenge over his lost career. Brock dies after the symbiote
leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host. Spider-Man
tricks the symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.

When Carnage gives birth to a new symbiote, Venom names it Toxin and
hopes to turn it into an ally. When Toxin shows compassion, Venom
tries to kill him. Toxin is rescued by Spider-Man and Black Cat.

In the 2004 story "Venomous", Brock experiences a crisis of faith and
decides to sell the symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his
cancer without it, intending to donate the $100 million received from
the sale to charity on the grounds that the symbiote would find another
host once he dies anyway. The symbiote is purchased by crime boss
Don Fortunato for his son Angelo Fortunato. Angelo briefly becomes
the second Venom but proves an unworthy host, and the symbiote abandons
him mid-jump allowing him to fall to his death. Upon learning of
Angelo's death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting
his wrists. Brock next appeared in the 2007 story "The Last
Temptation of Eddie Brock", where he is rapidly succumbing to cancer,
and experiencing hallucinations of "Venom". Finding a comatose Aunt May
in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot, the Venom hallucination
persuades him to kill her. Brock, dressed in a novelty replica of
Spider-Man's black costume at the demand of "Venom", murders a nurse
to test if he can still kill, but ultimately refuses to kill May because
she is innocent. When Peter visits May, he finds Eddie, who has
repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of "Venom". Eddie asks for
Peter's forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to
catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see
"Venom" but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows
that Brock is in control.

Anti-Venom

[Eddie Brock's first appearance as Anti-Venom] The 2008 story _"New Ways
to Die"_ features the return of Brock. Matt Murdock convinces a court of
law that Brock is not responsible for his actions while bonded to the
symbiote and has criminal charges against him dropped. Brock gets a
job at a soup kitchen under Martin Li. Brock is unknowningly cured of
his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, and Brock believes it
to be a miracle. After Brock is attacked by the new Venom, Mac
Gargan, the symbiote attempts to reunite with Brock. Brock's skin
becomes caustic to the symbiote, and he is enveloped in a new white
symbiote forged from the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body
bonding with his white blood cells charged with Li's healing energy,
becoming Anti-Venom. Brock defeats Gargan and nearly kills the Venom
symbiote. When Brock detects remnants of the symbiote inside Spider-Man,
he attempts to "cure" him, draining radiation from his body and nearly
de-powering him. While later saving Spider-Man from Norman Osborn,
Brock again fights a battle-suit enhanced Gargan and the recovering
symbiote. Gargan hits Anti-Venom with his stinger, injecting a
poisonous formula that seemingly destroys Brock's suit. When Gargan
attempts to kill Brock, the Venom symbiote stops him. Brock's Anti-Venom
suit later reforms.

Brock later faces the villain Mister Negative and discovers that he and
Li are the same person. Learning that the man he idolized is a
supervillain causes a breakdown for Brock, making him question his
faith, referring to himself as a monster. After this revelation he
becomes increasingly unstable mentally, murdering small-time criminals
as he did during his "lethal protector" days. He briefly and reluctantly
teams up with the Punisher to stop a drug cartel that kidnapped a friend
of Brock's. In _"The Return of Anti-Venom"_ (2011), Brock is unable
to expose Negative's true identity, believing no one will trust him.
Anti-Venom starts a crusade against Negative, attacking his criminal
operations. When Anti-Venom realizes that May Parker also knows
Negative's identity, he decides to attack Negative directly before
Negative can silence her. Brock teams up with Spider-Man and the
new Wraith to fight Negative. Wraith uses her technology to publicly
reveal Mister Negative is Martin Li, sending him into hiding. Spider-Man
and Anti-Venom call a truce to their rivalry.

In a 2011 New Avengers storyline, Brock joins Wonder Man's Revengers
to destroy the New Avengers. During the 2011 "Spider-Island"
storyline in which 99% of New York City's population are transformed
into mind-controlled spiders, Brock is forced to sacrifice the
symbiote—and being Anti-Venom—so that it can be converted into a
powerful curative capable of healing the infected
millions.

Later, a new Anti-Venom is seen in the crowd of new heroes attending a
"self help" style seminar being held by Roderick Kingsley (the first
Hobgoblin). All the new heroes have been given heroic personas by
Kingsley that already exist but are no longer used. It is not shown
whether the new Anti-Venom is indeed a symbiote or just a man in a suit
designed to look like the original symbiote, however the speech bubble
used for the character is stylized in a way to suggest a distortion of
the characters voice similar to the way Eddie Brock spoke when he had
the Anti-Venom symbiote.

Toxin

A powerless Brock returns in Venom vol. 2 #15 (2012), where he kills
the symbiotes Hybrid and Scream as part of a crusade to destroy the
aliens entirely, believing them to be evil. After failing to kill
the newest Venom, Brock is captured by the villain Crime Master and
forcibly bonded with the Toxin symbiote. Brock (who is being
controlled by the Toxin symbiote) then tracks down Venom and attempts to
kill him, but is defeated. Eddie and Agent Venom face off once more
at Crime Master's HQ, and Flash is able to subdue Toxin and separate
Eddie from the symbiote using a flamethrower. Just before Flash can get
Eddie out, the Toxin symbiote grabs hold of him and drags him into the
flames. Eddie and the Toxin symbiote both survive the flames and
track Flash to Philadelphia. Now in control of the Toxin symbiote,
he confronts Flash in the high school where he works as a gym
teacher. After helping Flash defend the students from a group of
cybernetic parasites, Eddie forms a truce with him, promising to leave
Flash alone as long as he has the Venom symbiote under control (similar
to the truce he had with Spider-Man). Eddie subsequently leaves
Philadelphia to resume his vigilante activities.


Powers and abilities

Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the Symbiote.
Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength
from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training
exercise. After separating from the Symbiote and suffering
from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the
strength of an average human. Brock's cancer is cured in the
2008 story New Ways to Die, and he is later shown with a restored
large physique. He is also shown to be proficient in combat and
capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered
enemies.

As Venom

As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man,
the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed,
agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces
with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like
substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's. However, this webbing
is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means
that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.
The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or
manipulate items from a distance. When bonded with the host, the
Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing
the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from
high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely
weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong
enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill
Brock.

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping
bladed weapons, bullets, and it can help its host survive in
hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater
and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to
create disguises at will, and camouflage itself, even
emulating water. It is also capable of psychically detecting its
offspring; however, this ability can be blocked. This sense can be
used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect
and be detected by the Symbiote and its children. The Symbiote
is capable of healing injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing
the host to survive otherwise mortal damage. The Symbiote and host
are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote able to pass on
information from previous hosts to future ones.

As Anti-Venom

Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause
Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within
his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid
antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities. Brock is
capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering
almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to
his brain. However, this healing ability can be negated by the
energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.
Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill and "cure" or
"cleanse" them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing
narcotics and even radiation from a person's body. Following a
failed attempt to "cure" Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his
body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man's powers
whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote,
inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to
dissolve. He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing
super strength, speed, negating Spider-Man's spider-sense, and
being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.
He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create
disguises, form items such as shields, extend his reach,
attack from a distance, and create tendrils. Anti-Venom is
also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage
or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound. The only
shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic "super venom"
created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit,
and Mr. Negative's energy. The "super venom" causes the suit to
immediately dissolve. Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his
energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.
