Fictional character biography

Pulsar is a long-time member of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, also known as
IMPULSE. He is made of pure energy, and his form is only contained by
his costume. He can release blasts of energy from his visor.

He was with the Imperial Guard the first time they fought the X-Men.

He was seemingly killed by Vulcan, who breached Impulse's suit. Pulsar
later reappeared alive, battling alongside the rest of the Imperial
Guard in an assault on the Kree, where Pulsar gravely wounded the
Inhuman elite warrior, Gorgon.


Inspiration

Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based
on members of the  team Legion of Super-Heroes. (Dave Cockrum,
co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.)
Pulsar is based on LSH member Wildfire.
