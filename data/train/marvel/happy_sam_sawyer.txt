Fictional character biography

HAPPY SAM SAWYER was assigned to the British Commandos by the U.S. Army.
He trained in parachuting in Britain in 1940 by Finley's Flying circus
that comprised daredevil parachutist Nick Fury and pilot Red Hargroves
where they nicknamed him Happy Sam ironically, because of his deadly
serious and consistently stony demeanor. In 1942 Sawyer, who had been
wounded in North Africa and was deemed unfit for combat missions,
organised and led the Howling Commandos, Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Jim
Morita's Nisei Squad, and Sgt Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders as
well as the Deadly Dozen. When artist John Severin joined Sgt Fury and
his Howling Commandos with issue #44, Severin drew Sawyer as being much
older and balder than his original depiction as a young man.

In a Sgt Fury annual set in the Korean War, Sawyer was a Colonel, in
another annual set in the Vietnam War, Sawyer was a full general.

In modern times, Baron Strucker created an LMD of Sawyer that attacked
the original Howling Commandos as well as Captain America. Sawyer would
sacrifice himself when the LMD detonated itself while trying to gain
missile navigation override codes.

In the wake of his death, a S.H.I.E.L.D. assault Helicarrier has been
named in his honor in the mini-series Iron Man: Hypervelocity.
There is also a Samuel J. Sawyer Memorial Veterans Hospital.
