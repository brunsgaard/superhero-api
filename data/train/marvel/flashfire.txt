Princess-Majestrix Lilandra from her insane brother, then-Majestor
D'Ken. Following their emperor’s orders, the Guard fought with the X-Men
and were on the brink of victory when the band of interstellar
freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle
in the X-Men's favor.

Later, Flashfire is one of the many Guardsmen to battle Vulcan. He is
wounded, but survives the battle, unlike many of his comrades.
