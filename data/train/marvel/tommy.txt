Fictional character biography

[ Tommy ]Tommy is a young Morlock living under the streets of New York.
She flees the city after the Marauders kill some of her Morlock friends
under as yet undetailed circumstances. She is rescued by the Hellfire
Club mercenary Richard Salmons and brought to Los Angeles, where the
Marauders track her down. Stunned by one of Harpoon's spears, Richard
begs Tommy to give him his gun. Tommy panicks and flees, abandoning
Richard, who was soon afterwards shot by Scalphunter.

Tommy hitchhikes a train ride back to New York. She is trailed by some
of the Marauders to 'The Alley', the Morlock home in the New York sewer
tunnels. Just when Tommy is about to flee into the tunnels, she is
incapacitated by Harpoon and then shot by Scalphunter off-panel. She
was the first person to die in the  Mutant Massacre.

Retcon

-   Although Uncanny X-Men #210 shows that the Marauders followed her

    Massacre to say that Gambit was responsible for leading the
    Marauders to the Alley.
